## Copper monosulfide
Copper monosulfide is a chemical compound of copper and sulfur.It occurs in nature as the dark indigo blue mineral covellite.It is a moderate conductor of electricity.A black colloidal precipitate of CuS is formed when hydrogen sulfide,H2S,is bubbled throughWhat happens when copper sulphate reacts with ammonium.Presumably,the hydrated copper sulfate (CuSO4 5 H2O) has been dissolved in water which places the copper ions (Cu2+) in solution.If a drop or two of ammonium hydroxide is added to this solution,initially,a small amount of copper (II) hydroxide.
