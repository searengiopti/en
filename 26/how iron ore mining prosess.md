## Mining and Refining Process
Conditions within the digester (caustic concentration,temperature and pressure) are set according to the properties of the bauxite ore.Ores with a high gibbsite content can be processed at 140&#176;C,while b&#246;hmitic bauxites require temperatures between 200 and 280&#176;C.Extracting Ores Mining Of Mineral Resources SiyavulaThe first iron mining techniques used charcoal which was mixed with iron ore in a bloomery.When heating the mixture and blowing air (oxygen) in through bellows,the iron ore is converted to the metal,iron.The chemical reaction between iron oxide and carbon is used here to produce iron.

## Sintering: A Step Between Mining Iron Ore and Steelmaking
World resources are estimated to be greater than 800 billion tons of crude ore containing more than 230 billion tons of iron.The only source of primary iron is iron ore,but before all that iron ore can be turned into steel,it must go through the sintering process.Sinter is the primary feed material for making iron and steel in a blast furnace.Iron Ore HowStuffWorksMost important,it releases oxygen from the iron ore,which makes up a high percentage of common iron ores.The most primitive facility used to smelt iron is a bloomery.There,a blacksmith burns charcoal with iron ore and a good supply of oxygen (provided by a bellows or blower).Charcoal is.
