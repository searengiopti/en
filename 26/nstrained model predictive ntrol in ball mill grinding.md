## [PDF] Application of Soft Constrained MPC to a Cement Mill.
Abstract In this paper we develop a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for regulation of a cement mill circuit.The MPC uses soft constraints (soft MPC) to robustly address the large uncertainties present in models that can be identified for cement mill circuits.The uncertainties in the linear predictive model of the cement mill circuit stems from large variations and heterogeneities in the.Robust Model Predictive control of Cement Mill circuitsRobust Model Predictive control of Cement Mill circuits A THESIS submitted by M GURUPRASATH.The present work considers the control of ball mill grinding circuits which are.In order to improve the performance of MPC,a moving horizon constrained reg
