## In What Rock Formations Can Gold Be Found? Sciencing
Gold is most often found in very small amounts mixed with other materials.Experienced gold prospectors rarely look for gold,but rather look for rocks and rock formations that are known to hold gold.Gold is most often found in quartz rock.When quartz is found in gold bearings areas,it is possible that gold will be found as well.Ore Deposit Geology by John Ridley Cambridge Core'As a teacher of an ore geology graduate course,I would efinitely suggest that this book is an improvement on what was previously available.it delivers on its aim to convey a systematic scientific approach to understanding ore formation and I think,if used as a course book,it will help develop a generation of students with solid process.

## Iron oxide copper gold ore deposits Wikipedia
Iron oxide copper gold ore deposits (IOCG) are important and highly valuable concentrations of copper,gold and uranium ores hosted within iron oxide dominant gangue assemblages which share a common genetic origin.These ore bodies range from around 10 million tonnes of contained ore,to 4,000 million tonnes or more,and have a grade of between 0.2% and 5% copper,with gold contents ranging.Hydrothermal alteration and fluid pH in alkaline hosted.1.Introduction.Epithermal Au (Ag) deposits form in shallow hydrothermal and magmatic hydrothermal systems.A number of studies (Richards,1995,Jensen and Barton,2000,Müller,2002,Sillitoe,2002) have recognised that epithermal deposits developed in alkaline host rocks tend to have anomalous features relative to calc alkaline hosted systems they are commonly gold and telluride rich.

## Bituminous Coal Characteristics and Applications
Bituminous coal has slagging and agglomerating characteristics.Bituminous coal combustion releases more pollution into the air than sub bituminous coal combustion,but due to its greater heat content,less of the fuel is required to produce electricity.As such,bituminous and sub bituminous coals produce approximately the same amount of.Iron Uses,Pictures,Characteristics,Properties.Iron is not found free in nature but is found in iron ores such as hematite (Fe 2 O 3),magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and taconite.Commercially,iron is produced in a furnace at temperatures of about 2,000 o C by the reduction of hematite or magnetite with carbon.
