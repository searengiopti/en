Reinforced Concrete Design W.H.Mosley,J.H.Bungey.A new edition of an introductory text to the principles and methods of design for concrete structures.Although the detailed design methods generally conform to British Standards,much of the theory and practice is of a fundamental nature,and of use to engineers in other countries.An ELBS.Failure Modes in Concrete Beams: Flexural and Shear FailureFailure modes in reinforced concrete beams are classified into two major types: flexural failure and shear failure.The former occurs when the imposed load exceeds the flexural capacity of the materials of the beam,while the latter occurs due to deficiency in shear resistance between different materials of the beam.
