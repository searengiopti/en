## Strength development in concrete Understanding Cement
Concrete strength.Many factors influence the rate at which the strength of concrete increases after mixing.Some of these are discussed below.First,though a couple of definitions will be useful: The processes of 'setting' and 'hardening' are often confused: Setting is the stiffening of the concrete after it has been placed.A concrete can be 'set' in that it is no longer fluid,but it may.3 Aggregate Properties IN.gov3 Aggregate Properties Physical Properties Absoprtion,Porosity,and Permeability.voids between the particles influence the design of hot mix asphalt or portland cement concrete.3 5.The workability and the strength of both portland cement concrete and asphalt pavements
