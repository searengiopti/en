* Semi autogenous (SAG) grinding is a grinding process carried out with small amount of ball charge (4 15%) unlike ball mills and with the help of bigger parts crumbling the smaller parts of ore.* To achieve this type of grinding,SAG mills with large diameter and short length have been developedMill BoltingThe mill manufacturer specifies a load which is designed to be the optimum load applied to the bolts to hold the mill together for its entire life,which can be in excess of 20 years,some mill manufacturers specify an elongation,unfortunately they usually specify a torque figure which should in a best case produce the correct elongation,but.
