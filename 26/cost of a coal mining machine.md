## UNDERGROUND COAL MINING: FACTORS,COST,AND TIME.
• Until the early 1970's,the majority of coal production in the U.S.was via underground mining methods.• Advancements in technology (primarily hydraulics and explosives) and expansion of mining activities in the west (particularly in the PRB),have shifted mining trends from underground to surface production over the past 40 years.YearCoal mining and transportation U.S.Energy Information.Mining coal.Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth.Many U.S.coal deposits,called coal beds or seams,are near the earth's surface,while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.
