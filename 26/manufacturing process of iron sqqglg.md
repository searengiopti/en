Liquid iron collects at the bottom of the blast furnace,underneath a layer of slag.The blacksmith periodically lets the liquid iron flow out and cool.At this point,the liquid iron typically flows through a channel and into a bed of sand.Once it cools,this metal is known as pig iron.To create a ton of pig iron,you start with 2 tons (1.8.Carbonyl metallurgy WikipediaCarbonyl metallurgy is used to manufacture products of iron,nickel,steel,and other metals.Coatings are produced by vapor plating using metal carbonyl vapors.These are metal ligand complexes where carbon monoxide is bonded to individual atoms of metals.Iron carbonyl is stable as iron pentacarbonyl,where five carbon monoxide molecules are pendantly bonded to the iron atom,while nickel.
