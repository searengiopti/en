## Ball milling
A device used to reduce the particle size of materials,bodies or glazes.A ball mill is simply a container that is filled with pebbles (either of porcelain or stones e.g.Flint) into which a charge (powder or slurry) is put and that is then mechanically rotated to cause the tumbling pebbles to crush.XRD Mill McCrone perfect for XRD analysis RETSCHBecause of its unique grinding motion,the XRD Mill McCrone is particularly effective for this analytical method: The 48 cylindrical grinding elements grind the samples gently via friction.The result is a short grinding time with almost no sample loss and an exceptionally narrow particle size distribution.
