## How metals are extracted from their ores? AnswersDrive
How metals are extracted from their ores? The method used to extract metals from the ore in which they are found depends on their reactivity.For example,reactive metals such as aluminium are extracted by electrolysis,while a less reactive metal such as iron may be extracted by reduction with carbon or carbon monoxide.Mining Methods and Costs at the Mount Isa Mines Ltd.The Mount Isa property has been in operation since June,1931; during this period operations have changed from the production and treatment of carbonate ores to the mining,milling,and smelting of sulphide ores.This change involved revision of ore extraction methods.Stoping methods have been designed to apply to parallel lodes ranging from 10 ft.
