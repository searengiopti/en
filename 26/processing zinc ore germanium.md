## Process for the recovery and purification of germanium.
 · Process for the recovery and purification of germanium from zinc ores.United States Patent 4090871.Abstract: The invention provides a process for recovering germanium as germanium oxide from a germaniferous metallic zinc which involves distilling the germaniferous metallic zinc under non oxidizing conditions,recovering the.Zinc smelting WikipediaZinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals,e.g.iron,because in contrast,zinc has a low boiling point.
