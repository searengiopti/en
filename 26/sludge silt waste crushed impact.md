## Sludge management sand & aggregate washing plants,CDE
Efficient operation of your filter press requires that all sand particles are removed from your sludge prior to delivery to the filter press.Traditional sand washing systems such as bucket wheels or screw classifiers are not very efficient at capturing all of the sand within the washed product and some sand finds its way into the waste sludge.Nature’s Water Filter2016 7 22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Nature’s Water Filter Soil Infiltration Investigation Objective Students will be able to under stand: •the difference between water cycling through an urban environment versus a natural environment.•that water is naturally filtered through particles in the soil.•that different sized soil parti cles have different infiltration rates.
