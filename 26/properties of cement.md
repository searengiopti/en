## Effect of Fineness of Cement on Concrete Properties.
Jan 06,2018 · Fineness of cement is a characteristic property of cement that signifies the particle size of cement and its specific surface area.Greater fineness of cement means the particles are finer and had more surface area.In case of very coarse cement.Chemical Admixtures cement.orgAccelerating admixtures are especially useful for modifying the properties of concrete in cold weather.Superplasticizers,also known as plasticizers or high range water reducers (HRWR),reduce water content by 12 to 30 percent and can be added to concrete with a low to normal slump and water cement ratio to make high slump flowing concrete.
