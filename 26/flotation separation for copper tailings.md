## Mineral Flotation,Flotation Separation,Forth Flotation.
Froth flotation is the use of the physical and chemical properties of the surface of the ore,the use of chemical separation of useful ore.In the process of froth flotation,useful minerals are separated by floating them in the foams,and the way of keeping gangue minerals in the pulp is called positive flotation,while the way of floating.Mine Tailings,Tailings in Mining,Gold Tailings.Copper tailings:  if the copper with high heavy metals content,the separation will be easier and apply the process of flotation.If there exist magnetite in the copper tailings,it will firstly using acid leaching to precipitate the copper,then use magnetic separation accordingly.
