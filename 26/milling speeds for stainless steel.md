## Can anyone give me advice on face milling 304 …
Can anyone give me advice on face milling 304 stainless?.As for speeds and feeds,I'd run at 150 200m min (about 500 650sfm?) and 0.2 mm flute (0.08&quot; ?).I found the key to milling 304 was to push the feed rate up a little,to force the chips off of the job I actually found lots of swarf re adhering to the job,even with plenty of coolant.Speeds and feeds WikipediaFor Tool Diameters 1 8" and Under: AD = Dia.of Tool X 0.25 to 0.05.For AD between 0.25 to 0.5 of Tool Dia.SFM = 0.8 Lowest Range Value.Feed at Suggested Value.SFM = 0.8 X Highest Speed Range.Feed should be 0.5 X Suggested Value.For Radial Depth of Cut use 0.25 X Tool Dia.Use Higher SFM Range.For Long and Extra Carbide Reduce Feed by 50%.
