## Extraction of Zinc Application Of Zinc Refining Process
The best concentration method for zinc ore is known as froth flotation.Concentration of Ore: Froth Flotation Process.Froth Flotation process is mainly used to remove gangue from sulphide ores.The ore is powdered and a suspension is created in water.The main ingredients of the froth flotation are the Collectors and Froth Stabilizers.Flotation Froth an overview ScienceDirect TopicsThe froth flotation technique was originally developed in about 1910 to raise the copper concentrations of the strip mined ores of Bingham Canyon,near Salt Lake City [9],and was further perfected for the differential separation of lead,zinc,and iron sulfides at Trail,B.C.at about the same time [10].Flotation technologies are now widely.
