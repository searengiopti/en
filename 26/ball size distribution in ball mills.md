## The effect of ball size distribution on power draw,…
balls,meaning that the ball size distribution had some effect on crushing and grinding (Zhang et al.2014).However,the horizontal planetary ball mill is different than the tumbling ball mill in many aspects.Djordjevic (2005) studied the influence of ball charge size distribution on the net power draw of tumbling mill based on DEM modeling.Ball millA ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotati
