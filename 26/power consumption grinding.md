A grinder may have an input power of 750 watts,but this number does not necessarily translate to actual grinding power.When a tool is used,power is lost through heat from several areas of the tool,such as the cord,wiring,and motor.This decreases the overall power used for operation of the tool.Best energy consumption International Cement ReviewFor raw grinding with relatively dry raw materials,the combination of the roller press and V separator is a viable alternative with far lower mill fan power.Cement grinding.For cement grinding,the technology development away from ball mills has taken a different route.
