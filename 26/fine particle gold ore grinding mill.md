## Fine grinding: How mill type affects particle shape.
The shape characteristics of the ore going into the plant scale ball mill and IsaMill,and coming out of the IsaMill are very similar,and these are close to the shape characteristics of particles in the laboratory feed,as well as progeny from the laboratory stirred mill.Although fine and ultra fine grinding in the laboratory ball mill …Factors Influence Ore Grinding Mill Efficiency2020 2 2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The medium filling rate is the volume ratio of the medium and grinding cavity,moves in throwing and falling state in a ball mill.The throwing motion medium is used to smash large ore,and the medium of falling movement mainly plays the role of grinding.The filling rate of the fine grinding mill is about 5% lower than that of the coarse grinding.

From the cone crusher,ore is fed to the grinding circuit.Grinding in ball mill or rod mills further reduces the ore particle size,as needed.In some cases,ore and water are fed directly into an autogenous mill; or,a semiautogenous mill.Between each grinding unit operation,hydrocyclones are used to classify coarse and fine particles.Primary Crusher Particle Size Gold OreThe slurry that remains after this process has a very fine particle size.Typically,80% of the ore particles are less than 70 microns in size (about the same consistency as fine beach sand).Such a fine particle size is required for gold liberation the size required for the cyanide to be able to 'see' the gold in the leaching process.
