Reddish to black colored heavy mineral sands occur alongside the several hundred kilometer long placer district in the Erongo and S Kunene regions in Namibia and are the focus of this study The sedimentary packages of these nearshore marine ‘garnet’ and ‘magnetite’ placers consist of millimeter to decimeter thick discontinuous.Ilmenite SandatlasIlmenite is an iron titanium oxide It is the principal ore of titanium It is black (or dark gray) and has a metallic luster It is usually weakly magnetic The mineral itself is actually not magnetic,but it is often intergrown with magnetite,which very strongly responds to the magnetic force You can use a hand held magnet to test sand grains
