## Antimony Mining Encyclopedia of Arkansas
Antimony (Sb) is a hard,brittle,silver white metal with a relatively high specific gravity (6.69) and a relatively low melting temperature.Antimony is a constituent in some alloys.The presence of this metal hardens the alloy,lowers the melting point,and decreases contraction during solidification.The metal's main use is to impart stiffness and hardness to lead alloys.the mining process of antimonyfloatation mining process for antimony · Wolframite Mineral Processing Xinhai Mining Machinery floatation mining process for antimony,Xinhai wolframite mineral processing is a combined separating technology which mainly use gravity separation,In this stage,by using the process of table flotation of coarse and fine particle fractions.
