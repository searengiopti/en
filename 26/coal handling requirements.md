## How to Calculate the Coal Quantity Used in a Power Plant.
Since coal has a heat value of 20,000 kJ kg,for producing one kw.hr we require (10765 20000) 0.538 kg of coal.This translates to (0.538 x 100 x 1,000) 53800 kg hr (53.8 T hr) of coal for an output of 100 MW.Basic cost of coal depends on the market conditions.Transportation costs,regional influences and government taxes are also part of.Federal Register :: Standards of Performance for Coal.For coal handling operations,the proposed amendments would reduce Start Printed Page 25317 the current opacity standard from less than 20 percent to no greater than 5 percent.The proposal would thus reduce the opacity standard by 75 percent.
