## Estimating Bulk Density For Mineral Resource Reporting,
Bulk density is a critical component of the resource estimate For mineral deposits with low metal content and simple mineralogy,calculating an average of all bulk density measurements can be adequate with sufficient data and a meaningful average However,each geological domain must be examined individually with a separate bulk density value.2.3 Density of minerals,soils and rocksThe effect of density on porosity follows a mixing law.The porosity,is the fractional pore volume of a rock.The total mass of a volume of rock V T is made up of the mass of the pore fluid,of density f,plus the mass of the matrix minerals of density ma The density measured is the bulk density b.The total mass then becomes:
