## Frequency Wikipedia
The relation between the frequency and the period.For periodic waves in nondispersive media (that is,media in which the wave speed is independent of frequency),frequency has an inverse relationship to the wavelength,λ.Even in dispersive media,the frequency f of a sinusoidal wave is equal to the phase velocity v of the wave divided by.What is the relation between frequency and amplitude.Like Kerry said,their is no relation between frequency and amplitude.They just happen to be the two most common measured values for a typical wave.If you used an.

## Order Tracking,Frequency and Hertz
Why use order tracking?.between the order,OR,the shaft speed,R.to get orders because we can use the relationship between frequency in Hz.Speed,Frequency and Wavelength How they are relatedIn this example we will consider the frequency of radio waves.Radio waves are just another form of &quotlight" i.e.part of the electromagnetic spectrum,and so travel at the speed of light.Let's say we have a radio with a dial that is only marked in MHz.This is a measurement of frequency and we note that 1 MHz is the same as 1 million hertz (the M in MHz stands for &quotmega" which means million).
