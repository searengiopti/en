If,for example the mill is designed with five passages for maximum extraction and the number of roller mills in each passage is below the certain minimum,this will not assist in the milling operation to obtain the best extraction with the minimum production of bran powder and fine break flour.Potential of Cellulosic Ethanol to Overcome Energy Crisis.Liquid biofuel industry in Pakistan may become a promising source for saving our foreign exchange and environment.Currently,bioethanol production is dependent on cane molasses,a product of sugar industry.Harnessing of more bioethanol from lignocellulosic waste crop residue has potential to respond to the fuel scarcity.Lignocellulose exists in nature as a polymer and serves as the largest.
