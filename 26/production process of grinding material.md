The earliest methods used for producing flour all involved grinding grain between stones.These methods included the mortar and pestle (a stone club striking grain held in a stone bowl),the saddlestone (a cylindrical stone rolling against grain held in a stone bowl),and the quern (a horizontal,disk shaped stone spinning on top of grain held.production process of grinding materialGlass Manufacturing Process # 2 Preparation of Batch The raw materials cullet and decolouriser are finely powdered in grinding machin These materials are accurately weighed in correct proportions before they are mixed together The mixing of these materials is carried out in mixing machines until a uniform mixture is obtained
