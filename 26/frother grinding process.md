## Froth Flotation Process Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The Froth Flotation Process is about taking advantage of the natural hydrophobicity of liberated (well ground) minerals metals and making playing on making them hydrophobic (water repel) individually to carefully separate them from one another and the slurry they are in.For this purpose we use chemicals reagents: Frothers.Flotation Froth an overview ScienceDirect TopicsThe last step in the flotation process is creating a strong but short lived froth by adding frother when the bubbles reach the surface of the slurry.This froth prevents bursting of the bubbles and release of the Cu mineral particles back into the slurry.
