## What is Ore?
Ores are types of rock deposits that contain enough metal to be economically viable for mining.There are many ways to extract ore from deposits.Metals found in ores include gold and iron.The Most Precious Bronze Age Artefacts Were Made With. · While previous studies had found specific Bronze Age objects to be made from meteoric metal like one of the daggers buried with King Tutankhamun this latest research answers the question of just how widespread the practice was.Albert Jambon,from the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) in France,studied museum artefacts from Egypt,Turkey,Syria,and China,…

## 1.1 PHASES OF A MINING PROJECT
In almost every project,metallic ores are buried under a layer of ordinary soil or rock (called ‘overburden’ or ‘waste rock’) that must be moved or excavated to allow access to the metallic ore deposit.For most mining projects,the quantity of overburden generated by mining is enormous.The ratio of the quantity of overburden to theBeneficiationIn the mining industry or extractive metallurgy,beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals,which results in a higher grade product (concentrate) and a waste stream ().There are many different types of beneficiation,with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.
