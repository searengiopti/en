## Bioleaching
Metals are found often as alloys in which they are in their nonvalent elemental form in WEEE.The process requires an additional energy source for the bacteria,i.e.iron and sulfur for the autotrophs,and additional carbon source and electron donor for the heterotrophic bacteria.A review of recovery of metals from industrial wasteiron oxidizing bacterium (IOB) and a mixed culture.The leaching efficiencies obtained for the metal,Zn,were up to 81%,and the leaching efficiencies for Al were up to 52%.Highly toxic Cd was Cu,Ni,and Cr were 89,64,and 12%,respectively.Ishigaki et al.[40] also.
