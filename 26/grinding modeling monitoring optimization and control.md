## Dimensional Characterization of Grinding.
Since the basic grinding relationships for modeling and simulation are well established [13] most of the grinding automation needs are now the development of monitoring systems for grinding control.The use of acoustic emission (AE) as a source of information for grinding control has been investigated extensively in the last 5 years.Fuzzy Adaptive Control Optimization of High Hardness.2010 9 21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The experimental results indicate that the fuzzy adaptive control optimization strategy based on dynamic threshold can decrease the roughness of the workpiece without decreasing the grinding efficiency.It can avoid the scratches on the workpiece in the high
