## Ferrite (magnet) Wikipedia
A ferrite is a ceramic material made by mixing and firing large proportions iron(III) oxide (Fe 2 O 3,rust) blended with small proportions of one or more additional metallic elements,such as barium,manganese,nickel,and zinc.They are both electrically non conductive,meaning that they are insulators,and ferrimagnetic,meaning they can easily be magnetized or attracted to a magnet.Structural,electric,and magnetic properties of Mn perovskitesHowever,such a metallic and ferromagnetic phase as shown in doped manganese oxides,i.e.manganites,can&#39;t be explained only by the above exchange interaction.For this,Zener first proposed the double exchange interaction.[4] For the doped manganites which have the disordered mixture of.+.3.Mn and.+.4.
