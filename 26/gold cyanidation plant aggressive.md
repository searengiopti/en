## Gold cyanidation Wikipedia
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low grade ore by converting the gold to a water soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction.Production of reagents for mineral processing to recover gold,copper,zinc and silver represents.Gold Leaching Accelerant2020 2 23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;I am currently working on a project to replace or find a cheaper alternative to Leach Aid during the intensive cyanidation of gold concentrates (Au 500 3,000 g t,Ag 100 5,000 g t).The intensive leaching of the gold concentrates is currently being carried out in an Acacia Leach Reactor (1 TPD capa
