## HEMATITE (Iron Oxide)
Hematite has several varieties,each with their own unique names.Hematite Rose is a circular arrangement of bladed crystals giving the appearance of the flower of a rose.; Tiger Iron is a sedimentary deposit of approximately 2.2 billion years old that consists of alternating layers of silver gray hematite and red jasper,chert or even tiger eye quartz.Hydrothermal phase transformation of hematite to magnetite · Background.The more stable phases in iron oxides are hematite and magnetite.Hematite can be used in a lot of applications,such as sensors [],water photooxidation [],drug delivery [],lithium ion battery [],pigmentation [],solar cell [],etc.and magnetite can be utilized in biomedicine [7 11],magnetic devices [],etc.Therefore,studies about the nano microstructures of iron oxides and.

## Banded Iron Formations BIF Geology In
Banded iron formations (also known as banded ironstone formations or BIFs) are distinctive units of sedimentary rock that are almost always of Precambrian age.A typical BIF consists of repeated,thin layers (a few millimeters to a few centimeters in thickness) of silver to black iron oxides,either magnetite (Fe3O4) or hematite (Fe2O3),alternating with bands of iron poor shales and cherts.Hematite 101Hematite helps to absorb negative energy and calms in times of stress or worry.Hematite is a very protective stone and is great to carry to help you stay grounded in many situations.Hematite is also good for working with the Root Chakra,helping to transform negative energies into a more positive vibration.

## Hematite Wikipedia
Hematite,also spelled as haematite,is a common iron oxide with a formula of Fe 2 O 3 and is widespread in rocks and soils.Hematite forms in the shape of crystals through the rhombohedral lattice system,and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and corundum.Hematite and ilmenite form a complete solid solution at temperatures above 950 °C (1,740 °F).Republic TownshipRepublic Township Master Plan “Draft” Septem Questions?
