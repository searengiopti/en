## Optimization of parameters in cylindrical and surface.
The experiments were conducted on the surface grinding machine with a cylindrical grinding attachment at different combinations of grinding process parameters.Experiments were performed at two values of grinding wheel speed,i.e.1400 and 2800 r.p.m.for both surface and cylindrical grinding operations.Li GF,Wang LS,Yang LB.2002 Multi.Used Internal Grinding Machines CNC Internal GrinderThe grinding spindle propels the grinding body and swivels on a skid to adjust the material removal.Most CNC internal grinding machines possess collision control.The internal grinder operates both dry,or with appropriate cooling.Cooling eases the removal of the milling waste,improving the accuracy of the surface.
