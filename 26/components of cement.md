## How Concrete is Made cement
The watercement ratio is the weight of the mixing water divided by the weight of the cement.Highquality concrete is produced by lowering the watercement ratio as much as possible without sacrificing the workability of fresh concrete,allowing it to be properly placed,consolidated,and cured.BASIC COMPONENTS OF MASONRY Lect2 Purdue …concrete,it cannot be ordered by the cubic yard.To understand its behavior,and to be able to specify masonry correctly,we must examine each of its basic components.Basic Components of Masonry: • units,• mortar,• grout,• accessory materials Units Masonry units,as noted below,can be classified as: • adobe (unfired clay.
