## Size reduction of material using ball mill
BACKGROUND The ball mill works on the principle of impact between the rapidly moving balls and the materials.Both the balls and the sample are enclosed in a hollow cylinder.At low speeds the ball rolled over each other and attrition takes place.1,2 At critical speed the centrifugal force just occurs as a result the balls are picked up by the mill wall and carried nearly the top where that.Best way to determine the ball to powder ratio in ball …The maximum power draw in ball mill is when ball bed is 40 % by volume in whole empty mill volume.Considering that ball bed has a porosity of 40 %,the actual ball volume is considered to be.
