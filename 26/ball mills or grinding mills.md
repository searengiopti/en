## Ball Mills
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter ( Figure 8.11 ).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.Industrial Ball Mills for Sale 911MetallurgistBall mills of greater length are termed "tube mills," and when hard pebbles rather than steel balls are used for the grinding media,the mills are known as "pebble mills.'' In general,ball mills can be operated either wet or dry and are capable of producing products on the order of 100 um.
