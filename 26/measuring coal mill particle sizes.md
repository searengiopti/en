## the particle size of less than 3 coal crusher
Mar 15,2004&#183; The particle size of each coal sample was reduced to less than 1 mm using laboratory size jaw crusher,cone and roll crushers followed by grinding in a laboratory size ball mill.The samples were then classified in to; −210+106,−106+74,−74+53,−53+35,−38+20,−20+10 and −10 μm size fractions by screening.Effect of coal particle size on the proximate composition.Yu et al.[5] studied the impact of coal particle size on proximate composition and combustion properties,the coal particle size ranged from 0.05 to 900 lm.Results of this study showed that a.
