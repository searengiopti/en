## How Much Does One Cubic Meter of Concrete Weigh.
General purpose concrete weighs a bit less at 1.6 tons per cubic meter.Concrete can be used for a variety of construction purposes,such as building the foundation of a building.It can also be used for paving projects.There are two different types of concrete that are used for these applications,and they each weigh a bit different.Calculate Cement Sand & Aggregate M20,M15,M10,M5.Hence in order to prepare 1 cubic meter of M20,M15 and M10 concrete you need 1.57 cubic meters of "total dry volume:" of cement,sand and aggregate and incase of M7.5 and M5 concrete you need 1.52 cubic meters.
