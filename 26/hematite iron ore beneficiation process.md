(with pictures)&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Iron ore mining often focuses on looking for hematite deposits known as red iron ore,and magnetite,as they have naturally weak magnetic fields that aid in their purification.Hematite,however,responds better to the flotation process in iron ore beneficiation than magnetite,so it is the preferred type of ore.

## Hematite and Itabirite Sundance Resources Limited
Hematite is often cheaper to process than other forms of iron ore as it generally does not require beneficiation due to its higher iron content.However,hematite ores may contain higher concentrations of contaminant elements (such as phosphorus,alumina and silica) and may therefore need to be blended prior to smelting.Metal Profile: Iron Ore The BalanceIron ore pellets.Iron ore is a vital input material in the production of primary steel.Relative abundance of the minerals hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4) make these the most sought after and economical sources of iron ore,although other source minerals include goethite (FeOOH),limonite (FeOOH*H2O) and siderite (FeCO3).

## Hematite Separation Process LinkedIn
Process Introduction.The early hematite beneficiation is mainly gravity separation with machines of jigger,centrifugal separator,spiral chute,spiral washer,shaking table can be involved and later floatation separation has been used in the hematite iron ore upgrading with floatation separator and magnetic separator involved.Magnetic separation line,Iron ore beneficiation plant.Natural iron ore like magnetic iron ore or hematite iron ore can make ore beneficiation after series of measures.The following is the process of ore separation: 1.Natural iron ore after coarse broken,then it will be further broken by Crusher.(Or use one stage ball mill and two stage ball mill to make ore grinding).
