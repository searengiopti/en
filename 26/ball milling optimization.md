## Size controlled MoS 2 nanosheet through ball milling.
The yield and dimensions of the exfoliated MoS 2 nanosheet were monitored by changing the parameters such as the weight ratio of bulk MoS 2 and SC (SC MoS 2),the filling ratio in the volume of milling ball and container (),milling ball size (d B),milling revolution speed (n R),and initial mass of bulk MoS 2.CEMENT GRINDING OPTIMISATIONKey words: dry grinding,process optimisation,modelling.There are efficiency factors for dry grinding,open circuit ball milling,mill diameter,oversize feed.
