## Lightweight concrete
Lightweight concretes can either be lightweight aggregate concrete,foamed concrete or autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC).Lightweight concrete blocks are often used in house construction.Lightweight aggregate concrete can be produced using a variety of lightweight aggregates.Properties and Internal Curing of Concrete Containing Recycled.10 Jul 2017.Internal curing by AAC LWA was also observed and found to provide sufficient water inside the specimens,leading to an achievement in higher compressive strength.The main goal of this study is not only utilising unwanted wastes from industry (recycling of waste materials) but also building up a new&nbsp;.
