## Antimony Mining
Antimony (Sb) is a hard,brittle,silver white metal with a relatively high specific gravity (6.69) and a relatively low melting temperature.Antimony is a constituent in some alloys.The presence of this metal hardens the alloy,lowers the melting point,and decreases contraction during solidification.The metal’s main use is to impart stiffness and hardness to lead alloys.Antimony.South Fork of the Salmon River [ID] American RiversThreat: Mining.The South Fork of the Salmon is a major tributary to the beloved Wild and Scenic Salmon River— the second longest free flowing river in the lower 48 states.The South Fork provides habitat for threatened and endangered fish and some of the state's best expert level whitewater.

## Seasonal variation of arsenic and antimony in surface.
The seasonal variation in lake water arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) concentrations was assessed in four small (&lt;1.5 km 2) subarctic lakes impacted by As and Sb emissions from legacy mining activities near Yellowknife,Northwest Territories,Canada.Substantial variation in As concentrations were measured over the two year period of study in all but the deepest lake (maximum depth 6.9 m.Antimony Mining Encyclopedia of ArkansasAntimony (Sb) is a hard,brittle,silver white metal with a relatively high specific gravity (6.69) and a relatively low melting temperature.Antimony is a constituent in some alloys.The presence of this metal hardens the alloy,lowers the melting point,and decreases contraction during solidification.The metal's main use is to impart stiffness and hardness to lead alloys.
