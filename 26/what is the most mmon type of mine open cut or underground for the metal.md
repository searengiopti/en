When the mineral seam becomes exposed,it is drilled,fractured and the mineral recovered for processing.Open cut mining can be more effective than underground methods,generally recovering 90% of a mineral deposit,and accounts for about 65% of raw coal production in NSW.Open cut mining is also used for some gold and copper production in NSW.Surface Mining Methods and Equipment2017 1 7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;open pit mining,followed by underground methods.Here,a brief comparison is made with respect to the advantages and disadvantages of various mining methods.Figures 1a and 1b show histograms of production sizes for metal mines operated during between 1988 and 1997 in the western world.Open pit mining is the most common

Open pit,open cast or open cut mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow.This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth,such as long wall mining.Open pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface.Dry Bulk News ArchiveBolivia and ACI Systems joint venture to mine lithium 19 December 2018: The aim of the joint venture is the sustainable extraction and industrialization of lithium from Salar de Uyuni,the world’s largest salt lake.China hopes for ‘orderly’ Brexit,calls for more open EU economy
