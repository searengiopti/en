Ball milling is a size reduction technique that uses media in a rotating cylindrical chamber to mill materials to a fine powder.As the chamber rotates,the media is lifted up on the rising side and then cascades down from near the top of the chamber.(PDF) Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process ControlBesides particle size reduction,ball mills are also widely used for mixing,blending and dispersing,amorphisation of materials and mechanical alloying [1,49,51].
