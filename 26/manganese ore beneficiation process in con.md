## Phase,Microstructure and Beneficiation of Manganese Ore.
The mineralogy of manganese ore is complex.The constituent phases of manganese ore samples identified using XRD analysis are Hausmannite (Mn 3 O 4),Calcium Aluminum Silicate Hydrate,Silica (SiO 2) and Hematite.The chemical beneficiation of manganese ore was carried out using a commercial grade concentrated H 2 SO 4 and sawdust as reductant.Manganese Ore Processing Mineral Processing & MetallurgyUnits with 3 compartments were chosen to give ample capacity to produce a high grade manganese product.Tailings from these jigs go to waste and the concentrates become shipping ore.Manganese Process Beneficiation Summary.This flowsheet is based upon the principle of recovering the mineral as soon as it is free from the gangue.
