## Bond Grindability Test Procedure
2020 2 29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Bond Ball Mill Grindability test is designed to give a measure of the grinding characteristics of a material by finding the amount of size reduction resulting from a controlled energy input.Ball Mill Grindability of a material depends upon its hardness,structure,the manner in which it is fractured.The grindability is useful in evaluating power requirements for grinding.To design a.Grindability index Article about grindability index by.The maximum possible grinding capacity depends on the coal character (grain composition,grindability index,rock concentration,moisture content etc.),on the dust system characteristics (drying,ventilation and grindability) and on the amount of coal fed into the mill,on the coal feeding system and its regime (Formusatin,2008).
