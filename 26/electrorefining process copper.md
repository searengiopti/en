Electrowinning Copper Key Concepts.Electrowinning refers to the process of using electrolysis to extract a metallic element from the compounds in its ore.Copper occurs on Earth both as native copper (the uncombined element,Cu),and in ores (copper compounds,or mixtures of compounds,from which copper metal can be extracted profitably).Lead Bullion Fire refining and Electrorefining Process LeadBefore electro refining,lead bullion has to be pre refined to reduce copper and tin content.After electro refining,lead cathode should be further fire refined before ingot casting.This process generates,except copper slag and tin slag,especially lead anode slime that contains valuable metals.
