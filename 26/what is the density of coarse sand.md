The bulk density is more in compacted state as compared to the loose which shows that the bulk density greatly depends on the degree of compaction or how densely it is packed.; Usually increase in bulk density should be above 15% for coarse aggregate and should be below 15% for fine aggregate,But in our results it is 11.20% for fine aggregate and 11.48% for coarse aggregate.How much does a cubic foot of sand weighDry sand has a density about 2.5 times that of water.Wet sand is slightly denser,at 3.0 times that of water.
