## raw materials of cement
Portland cement raw materials Portland cement consists of a mixture of calcium carbonate,silica,iron oxide and alumina.The primary raw material used in the production process is limestone,which is the source of calcium.Other raw materials include clay,shale,sand and ironstone.Production Process The raw materials are mixed andstandard operating process for raw mill in cement …Cement Industry Standard Practice to Add a Percentage of.Therefore,only one of the three finish mill additives — limestone,which is not available at the cement manufacturing loion — is to be procured,stored and added to the cement manufacturing operation.
