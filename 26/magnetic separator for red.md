## Iron Recovery from Red Mud by Reduction Roasting …
This work provided an effective method for comprehensive utilization of red mud,which mainly focused on the first step of recovering iron from a high iron content red mud by reduction roasting.Research on red mud treatment by a circulatingRed mud (RM) accumulated over the years and caused a serious environmental problem.Ironrich fraction separation is a costeffective way to reduce the amount of disposal RM.A circulating highgradient superconducting magnetic separator was produced in this work.Steel wool was filled in the circulating boxes.The boxes were connected by two chains,which moved in and out the magnetic

## Magnetic Separation Method
2020 2 29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Magnetic separation is a process used to separate materials from those that are less or non&#173;magnetic.All materials have a response when placed in a magnetic field,although with most,the effect is too slight to be detected.The few materials that are strongly affected (magnetised) by magnetic fields are known as “Ferromagnetics”,those lesser (though noticeably) affected are known as.Magnetic cell separation Cell separation MiltenyiMagnetic separators in columnbased and columnfree systems generate a comparable magnetic force.What makes the difference,is the column.When the column is placed in a MACS Separator,the magnetic field gets amplified by 10,000fold,due to the ferromagnetic spheres that are packed in
