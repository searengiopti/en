The environmental toll of underground mining is significant.It includes air pollution,changes in water flow patterns,chemical and gas seepage into water supplies and soil,inaccessible fires in abandoned mines,and dramatic changes in land composition that can make the area unusable after the mining operation is done [source: Saxena].Then there is the human toll.Appendix F: Underground Coal Mining Methods and.Longwall mining accounted for less than 1 percent of the underground production; room and pillar continuous mining accounted for about 50 percent of the underground production.By 2015,underground mining accounted for only 35 percent of U.S.coal production.

## Mining Wikipedia
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth,usually from an ore body,lode,vein,seam,reef or placer deposit.These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.Ores recovered by mining include metals,coal,oil shale,gemstones,limestone,chalk,dimension stone,rock salt,potash,gravel,and clay.The many advantages of underground miningHistorically speaking,underground mining not only saves the mining area’s original form but also gives the mining company higher revenues.According to MiningGlobal.com,longwall mining,a type of underground mining that utilizes a longwall shearer,accounts for 50 percent of coal mines in the world and is much safer than other methods of coal mining.

Although Rock Mechanics addresses many of the rock mechanics issues which arise in underground mining engineering,it is not a text exclusively for mining applications.It consists of five categories of topics on the science and practice of rock engineering: basic engineering principles relevant to rock mechanics; mechanical properties of rock and rock masses; design of underground excavations.UNDERGROUND MININGunderground mining industry produces a significant proportion of its coal,gold,nickel,copper,zinc,lead,tin,uranium and diamond exports.The size and scope of Australia’s underground mining industry,its safety culture,high production rates,and the technical challenges associated with depth,geology,seismicity,and mining

## Underground mining
Underground mining is done when the rocks,minerals,or gemstones are too far underground to get out with surfacemining.Some kinds of underground mining are: Borehole Mining Drift Mining Hard Rock Mining Shaft Mining Slope MiningSUPPORT IN UNDERGROUND HARD ROCK MINESThe choice of the type of support installed in a particular underground excavation depends upon the extent of the zone of loosened or fractured rock surrounding that excavation.A very crude guide to support selection is given in Table 1.Active rock reinforcement Underground mines use two principal types of rock reinforcement tensioned
