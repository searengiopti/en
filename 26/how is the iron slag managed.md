## Iron and Steel Slag Statistics and Information
In the production of iron,the blast furnace is charged with iron ore,fluxing agents,usually limestone and dolomite,and coke as fuel and the reducing agent.The iron ore is a mixture of iron oxides,silica,and alumina.From this and the added fluxing agents molten slag and iron are formed.22.Iron and The Old Stone Furnaces of Western Pennsylvania · These floating impurities are called slag and prior to “tapping” or “drawing off” the molten iron,the slag must first be removed to prevent it from contaminating the metal.Thus,the lime from limestone combines with the silica and allows the separation of the iron …
