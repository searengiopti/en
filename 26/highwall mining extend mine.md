## Highwall Mining RitchieWiki
Highwall mining is a method of mining that originated from auger mining.The method differs in that continuous miners,rather than augers,are used to bore an entry adjacent to the coal seam of a highwall left behind in an open pit mine after excavation has been completed.Screw conveyors positioned behind the continuous miner haul the cut coal.Surface Mining Methods and Equipmentexpensive surface mining method.Highwall mining is a coal mining method for recovery of outcropped coal by mechanical excavation without removal of overburden.A continuous miner with single or multiple augers cutting heads is operated underground and controlled remotely by crew located outside.
