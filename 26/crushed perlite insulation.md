## What is Perlite Insulation? (with pictures)
Dec 07,2019 · Perlite insulation is a type of insulation made from volcanic rock.The rocks used to make perlite insulation have a high water content,which helps to create large quantities of air pockets within the rock when heated.These air cells make perlite an excellent insulator,giving it a high level of thermal resistance.In its most basic state.Perlite natural glass BritannicaPerlite,also called pearlstone,a natural glass with concentric cracks such that the rock breaks into small pearl like bodies.It is formed by the rapid cooling of viscous lava or magma.Perlite has a waxy to pearly lustre and is commonly gray or greenish but may be brown,blue,or red.
