## Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses.
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50% of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.The.Variables in Ball Mill Operation Paul O.Abbe®Ball mill operation is often regarded as something of a mystery for several reasons.Ball milling is not an art it's just physics.The first problem will ball mills is that we cannot see what is occurring in the mill.The other problem is that many of the independent variables.
