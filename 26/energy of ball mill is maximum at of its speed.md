## Energy Use of Fine Grinding in Mineral Processing
Fine grinding,to P80 sizes as low as 7 μm,is becoming increasingly important as mines treat ores with smaller liberation sizes.This grinding is typically done using stirred mills such as the Isamill or Stirred Media Detritor.While fine grinding consumes less energy than primary grinding,it can still account for a substantial part of a mill's energy budget.Mill drives: the desire for increased power and the associated limits.to the process requirement of the associated mills over their intended operating life,and.These selected power levels and the total circuit specific energy consumption.speed,and the maximum design ball charge volume (Barratt,1989).
