## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores.
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Copper Ore Processing MethodsThe four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining,concentrating,smelting,and refining.In a few instances,however,leaching takes the place of concentrating,smelting,and refining.At present,although considerable leaching and direct smelting ores are produced,the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.The milling of copper ores as practiced in the larger.
