## Ball mil design calculation? Yahoo Answers
Mar 31,2008&nbsp&#0183&#32The power (in kW) required to turn a ball mill is approximated by: P = 0.285 d (1.073j) m n where d is the internal diameter in metres,j is the fraction of the mill volume occupied by media,m is the total mass of media in the mill,in tonnes,and n is the mill speed,rpm.The actual motor energy consumption is 510% greater than this due toMotor Sizing CalculationsMotor Sizing Calculations.There are three factors to calculate when sizing a motor; Moment of Inertia,Torque,and Speed.Moment of Inertia.Moment of inertia is the measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotation rate.When an object is just sitting without any motion,the moment of inertia is 0.
