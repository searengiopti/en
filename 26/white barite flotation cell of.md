## What's the Function of Flotation Froth in the Froth.
The theoretical basis of flotation cell is approximately same,namely the separation process is realized by flotation froth in the pulp according to the physical and chemical properties of mineral particles.In the froth flotation process,there is one thing that plays a very important role in the whole process——flotation froth.Efficiency of Barite Flotation Reagents a Comparative StudyIn this study,production of brown barite powder (SG 4.065 g cm³) was examined by flotation (direct and reverse) and magnetic separation for upgrading the quality of fine barite particles and.
