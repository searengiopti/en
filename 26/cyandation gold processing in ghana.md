## Should cyanide still be used in modern day mining?
Mar 07,2016 · The first gold bar produced with the thiosulphate process was poured in late 2014."Replacing cyanide with the non toxic thiosulphate stands to reduce environmental risks and open other opportunities in countries where gold cyanidation is banned," CSIRO team leader for gold processing,Dr Paul Breuer said in June.Processing,smelting and refining gold World Gold …2020 2 28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Processing,smelting and refining gold.From ore to dor&#233;.Cyanidation.More gold is recovered by cyanidation than by any other process.In cyanidation,metallic gold is oxidised and dissolved in an alkaline cyanide solution.When gold dissolution is complete,the gold bearing solution is separated from the solids.

## Newmont Gold Mine to Pay Ghana Millions for Cyanide Spill
ACCRA,Ghana,January 22,2010 (ENS) The government of Ghana has requested nearly 5 million in compensation from Denver based Newmont Mining for negligently spilling cyanide at its Ahafo gold.Major Mines & Projects Obuasi MineHigher gold grades tend to be associated with finer grain arsenopyrite crystals.Sulphide ore is generally refractory.The mine is located within the Obuasi concession area in south western Ghana along the north easterly striking Ashanti volcanic belt.The deposit is one of the most significant Proterozoic gold.

## Gold Cyanidation
Cyanide can be used to extract gold,either in a controlled mill environment,or more crudely on rock piles in the open.Cyanide "vat leaching" mixes finely crushed ore with a cyanide salt in water.The cyanide binds to the gold.
