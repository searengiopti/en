## Mining
Concentrated gold deposits require Mining level 80.Their experience multiplier is the same as a banite rock,but levelling benefits for banite do not apply.Concentrated gold deposits have 750 durability (compared to banite's 1,700) and grant five gold ore instead of one (working out to 150 durability per gold ore).Ore Rocks to Make the Fortune Enchantment Able to Affect.The Fortune enchantment deliberately does not work on iron and gold ore to avoid easy item duplication.However,this also means that players have no way to enhance their ore output,which is particularly troubling considering that iron is arguably one of the most useful materials in Minecraft and gold is needed for some important late game items.
