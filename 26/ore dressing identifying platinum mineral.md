Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing,paper recycling and waste water treatment industries.Historically this was first used in the mining industry,where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.A graphite project with no need for window dressing2020 2 24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A graphite project with no need for window dressing.Nov 22,2019.0.The eDFS has now confirmed that Mahenge will deliver consistent graphite ore quality across its JORC compliant mineral resource estimate of 212 Mt at 7.8% TGC (total graphite content).“Our focus remains on identifying the least dilutive option for our shareholders.
