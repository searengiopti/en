## 7 Effects of Mining and Processing of Mineral Resources on.
Some of the major environmental effects of mining and processing of mineral resources are as follows: 1.Destruction of Land 3.Impact on the Biological Environment 7.Long term Supplies of Mineral Resources.Mining and processing of mineral resources normally have a considerable im­pact on land,water,air,and biologic resources.Social.factors that favour mining in south africaThe Republic of South Africa is situated at the southern tip of Africa.and the remaining 6% is used for mining,urban and industrial development.C3 grasses and shrubs predominate,and this favours sheep and goat production.The biome was originally defined on climatic factors and is limited to summer and strong.
