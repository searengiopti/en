## CDC Mining How Does Limestone Rock Dust Prevent Coal.
Coal dust explosions in underground coal mines are prevented by generous application of rock dust (usually limestone).If an explosion should occur,the rock dust disperses,mixes with the coal dust and prevents flame propagation by acting as a thermal inhibitor or heat sink.Mineral Mining and Processing Effluent Guidelines.Wastewater is generated during mineral processing (e.g.stone cutting,wash water,scrubber water),from equipment cooling,from mine dewatering,and from stormwater runoff at mines and processing plants.Note: Hard rock mining of metals (ores) is covered in the Ore Mining Effluent Guidelines,40 CFR Part 440.Facilities Covered.
