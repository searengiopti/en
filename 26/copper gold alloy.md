For this phenomenon to occur the alloy must contain at least 11% copper and so some effect will be seen in type III gold alloys although it is seen more so with type IV.The amount of copper added works only up to a point as the alloy will tarnish if it contains more than 16% copper.Gold Jewelry Alloys,What's in Yellow and White Gold.Rose gold is a very popular alloy comprised of traditional yellow gold and copper,which lends a beautiful pinkish color tone to the metal.Rose gold is also be known as “red gold” or &quot;pink gold.&quot; Because rose gold is a man made alloy,“pure” rose gold does not exist.

Adding copper to gold makes it redder and adding silver,zinc and any other metal makes gold paler.Thus,we can understand that lower carat golds,because we can add more alloying metals,can have a wider range of colors than the higher carat golds.Table 1: Chemical composition of gold alloys with color and karat number
