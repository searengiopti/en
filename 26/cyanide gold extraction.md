Leaching dissolves the gold out of the ore using a chemical solvent.The most common solvent is cyanide,which must be combined with oxygen in a process known as carbon in pulp.As the cyanide and oxygen react chemically,gold in the pulp dissolves.When workers introduce small carbon grains to the tank,the gold adheres to the carbon.Gold cyanidation WikipediaHere I present an Process EXAMPLE of Gold Extraction Cyanide in which the cyanidation feed consists of a pyrite concentrate floated after the selective flotation of a copper gold concentrate.The pyrite concentrate is reground to 90% minus 325 mesh and aerated in a high lime solution prior to cyanidation.It contains 99% sulphides of which 10 to 20 percent is pyrrhotite and 0.3 to 0.7%.
