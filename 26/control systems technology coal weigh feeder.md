## Loss in Weight Overview : Plastics Technology
Loss in Weight Overview.Principle In loss in weight feeding,the entire feeder,hopper and material are continuously weighed.As the feeder discharges material,the rate of decline in system weight is computed,and feeder speed is adjusted to maintain the desired (set) rate.CFB Coal Feeding SystemFeb 26,2007 · Subject: Coal ( & sand & lime ) feeding system of CFB ( Circulating Fluidized Bed ) Boiler for Power plant Dear Dr.Wohlbier,We are preparing to propose the above mentioned system to our potential customer in Korea as the agent and partnership.Our customer is reviewing the system for CFB ( Circulating Fluidized Bed ) Boiler.

## Stock Coal and Limestone Feed Systems
gravimetric feed systems represent the standard for coal feed systems Volumetric CVF For those applications where weigh ing the coal is not desired Stock volumetric feeders are designed to reliably and safely deliver coal to the boiler and are built in the same tradition as the Stock gravimetric feeder They are both built to deliverGravimetric Feeders: The Achilles' Heel of Continuous.Gravimetric feeders are frequently used in continuous manufacturing processes.A gravimetric feeder relies on a control system that adjusts the speed of the feeder based on loss in weight measurements.Since the controller is unable to discern the discharge rate when its hopper is being filled with new material,two hoppers arranged in series are typically used.
