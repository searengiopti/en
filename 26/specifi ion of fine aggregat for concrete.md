## Aggregate Moisture and Making Adjustments to Concrete
This TIP outlines concepts on aggregate moisture for mixture proportioning and production of concrete The moisture content of an aggregate when batched in concrete mixtures is an important consideration.Aggregate particles have internal pores that absorb water.Aggregate stored in a stockpile or bin is typically in a wet condition,WHAT ARE THE PROPERTIES OF AGGREGATES FOR CONCRETE. · Specific Surface of Aggregate.The surface area per unit weight of the material is termed as specific surface.This is an indirect measure of the aggregate grading.Specific surface increases with the reduction in the size of aggregate particle.The specific surface area of the fine aggregate is very much more than that of coarse aggregate.

The specific gravity and water absorption of aggregates are important properties for designing concrete and bituminous mixes.Specific gravity of an aggregate is the ratio of the weight of a given volume of aggregate to the weight of an equal volume of water.It is a quality measure and determines the strength of aggregate.Determining Moisture in Aggregate for Mix Proportioning.Question: Is there an accurate,quick and inexpensive way to determine the percent of water in aggregate? Answer: I batch up to 100 cubic yards of concrete a week for our in house projects,using all applicable admixtures.Because the water in the aggregate varies,I have to guess at the amount of water for each mix.This takes unnecessary time and extra trial batches.

## Aggregates for Concrete
• For a good concrete mix,aggregates need to be clean,hard,strong particles free of absorbed chemicals or coatings of clay and other fine materials that could cause the deterioration of concrete.• Aggregates are divided into either ‘coarse’ or ‘fine’ categories. Coarse aggregates are particulates that are greater than 4.75mm.Concrete Aggregates Function,Properties.Fine aggregates contain particles in the size range 75 µm to 4.75 mm,and coarse aggregates from 4.75 to about 40 mm,except for mass concrete which may contain particles up to 150 mm.Most natural mineral aggregates,such as sand and gravel,have a bulk density of 1520 to 1680 kg cum and produce normal weight concrete.
