## Arsenic Pyrite Gold Extraction by Alkaline Leaching Oxidation
Gold recovery was proportional to arsenic extraction during the oxidative leach,with >90 pct Au extraction for arsenic extraction ≥ 89 pct.Silver extraction did not follow this trend and ranged from 47 to 62 pct.Cyanide consumption was 2.6 kg NaCN per metric ton of leach residue and 5.7 kg NaCN per metric ton for the untreated ore.Environmental occurrence and impacts of arsenic at gold.Arsenic is a common element in the natural environment and is frequently a significant component in gold deposits of the western United States.Such deposits contain various forms of arsenic: arsenides,sulfides,and sulfosalts.Upon weathering such minerals routinely lower the pH of nearby waters,mobilizing arsenic and other metals.Arsenic may also be mobilized in aqueous environments where.
