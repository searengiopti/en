## Laboratory studies on strength and bearing capacity of GSB,
By trial,a mix of Hoskote gravel,crushed aggregate and crusher dust in proportion of 40% of Hoskote gravel,40% of 20mm down aggregates and 20% of crusher dust yielded a GSB material satisfying gradation III as per MORT&H specification as shown in Table 4 The soaked CBR value for the mixture was found to be 55% TheComparative assessment of crushed aggregates and bound.With the increased awareness of building sustainable transportation systems,recycled materials and industrial byproducts increasingly are being used in highway construction,especially as base materials.When compared to traditional base materials,such as crushed aggregate,recycled materials and industrial byproducts often display unique properties.
