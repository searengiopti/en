## Processing,smelting and refining gold World Gold Council
For extracting gold from low grade ores,heap leaching is practiced; huge heaps are sprayed with a dilute solution of sodium cyanide,and this percolates down through the piled ore,dissolving the gold.There are very well defined rules for the safe and responsible use of cyanide as laid out in the International Cyanide Code.Gold refiningHow benchmarking can improve cost competitiveness in steel.Gas credits may differ when volumes are changed,potentially resulting in differences in cost performance.It follows that the way the benchmark for blast furnace productivity is assessed needs to be adjusted to align with the selected operating point.Gas consumption in a hot strip mill.

## Abstract
ABSTRACT.In this U.S.Bureau of Mines report,mine and mill cost models are presented to make quick estimates of the cost to develop mineral deposits in the desert region of the Southwest United States.Mineral Processing Operating Cost Estimate of Ore TreatmentThis mine is an open pit mine producing 5,000 tonnes ore and 5,000 tonnes waste per day.Rock characteristics for both ore and waste are typical of those of granite or porphyritic material.Operating conditions,wage scales,and unit prices are typical for western U.S.mining operations.All costs listed are in 2012 US$.
