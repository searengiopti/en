## Pelletizing Wikipedia
The formation of raw iron ore pellets,also known as pelletizing,has the objective of producing pellets in an appropriate band of sizes and with mechanical properties high usefulness during the stresses of transference,transport,and use.Both mechanical force and thermal processes are used to produce the correct pellet properties.Taconite Resources New MillenniumPellets are also an essential input for the growing direct reduced ironmaking methodology that feeds electric arc furnace steelmakers.Pellets are increasing as a proportion of iron ore grades consumed.As with most North American ores,NML's taconites must undergo concentration and pelletizing to be transformed into saleable products.

Iron ore pellet is a kind of agglomerated fines which has better tumbling index when compared with the iron ore and it can be used as a substitute for the iron ore lumps both in the BF and for DRI production.Pellets have good reducibility since they have high porosity (25 % to 30 %).Normally pellets are reduced considerably faster than sinter.Electrical and Process Control Equipment for New.iron ore mainly from the Malmberget Mine,but the Kiruna Mine will initially provide some ore.Blast furnace pellets will be the main prod uct,but the new plant is also intended to pro duce direct reduction pellets.The new plant is based on Outokumpu Tech nology's travelling gate concept.In the pel letizing process fine ground crude iron.
