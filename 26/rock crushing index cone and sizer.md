## Cone Crusher an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The cone crusher is therefore an excellent arrested crusher.The flare of the bowl allows a much greater head angle than in the gyratory crusher,while retaining the same angle between the crushing members.This gives the cone crusher a high capacity,since the capacity of gyratory crushers is roughly proportional to the diameter of the head.Crushers an overview ScienceDirect TopicsA gyratory crusher includes a solid cone set on a revolving shaft and placed within a hollow body,which has conical or vertical sloping sides.Material is crushed when the crushing surfaces approach each other and the crushed products fall through the discharging opening.Hammer crushers are used either as a one step primary crusher or as a secondary crusher for products from a primary crusher.
