## What Is Iron Ore Beneficiation? (with pictures) wisegeek
Jun 30,2019&#0183;&#32;Iron ore mining often focuses on looking for hematite deposits known as red iron ore,and magnetite,as they have naturally weak magnetic fields that aid in their purification Hematite,however,responds better to the flotation process in iron ore beneficiation than magnetite,so it is the preferred type of oreTreatment and Recycling of the Process Water in Iron …Figures 3(a) and 3(b) showed that an increasing PAM or PDADMAC concentration reduced the iron flotation recovery.However there was very little reduction in iron grade.When the concentration increased from 0 mg L to 3 mg L for PAM and 0 mg L to 30 mg L for PDADMAC,the recoveries of iron decreased from 74.66% to 66.74% and 74.66% to 64.63%,respectively.
