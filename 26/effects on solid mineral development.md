## 7 Terrible Effects of Industrial Pollution Earth Eclipse
Below are some of the prime effects of industrial pollution.Global Warming; Global warming is among the most serious outcome of industrial pollution,witnessed on the account of the steady rise of industrial activities.Industries release into the atmosphere a variety of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).Influence of Mineral Matters on Uptake of H2S by a Coke.In this regard,development of advanced pyrolysis technologies to reduce sulfur content in the solid and liquid products is of interests.There are many mineral matters in coal and which are unfavorable factors during coal pyrolysis.
