## An Experimental investigation on utilizations of Marble.
Most of the studies have focused on the replacement of marble dust with cement in the cement mortar [12].SEM test was conducted on the mortar sample.Optimum percentage of marble dust in concrete was not defined.Studies have shown that marble dust can be used as filler material in production of self compacting concrete [19 20].STUDY OF SELF COMPAC TING CONCRETE WITH PARTIAL.Self compacting concrete is not affected by the skills of workers,the shape and amount of reinforcing bars or the arrangement of a structure and,due to its high fluidity and resistance to segregation it can be pumped longer distances (Bartos,2000).

## [PDF] Study on Compressive Strength of Quarry Dust as Fine.
The concept of replacement of natural fine aggregate by quarry dust which is highlighted in the study could boost the consumption of quarry dust generated from quarries.By replacement of quarry dust,the requirement of land fill area can be reduced and can also solve the problem of natural sand scarcity.The availability of sand at low cost as a fine aggregate in concrete is not suitable and.Suitability of Quarry Dust as Partial Replacement Material.However,several researchers found that the incorporation of quarry dust as partial replacement material to sand in concrete resulted in a reduction in the compressive strength,and this was more.
