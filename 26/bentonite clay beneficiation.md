## Bentonite Everything about Bentonite!
Bentonite usually forms from weathering of volcanic ash,most often in the presence of water However,the term bentonite,as well as a similar clay called tonstein,has been used to describe clay beds of uncertain origin For industrial purposes,two main classes of bentonite exist: sodium and calcium bentonitebentonite for beneficiation of iron ore Mobile Crushing.bentonite for beneficiation of iron ore Bentonite Wikipedia.The main uses of bentonite are for drilling mud,binder (e.g.foundry sand bond,iron ore pelletizer),purifier,absorbent (e.g.stone litter),and as a groundwater barrier.
