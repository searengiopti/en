Until the 1950s of the last century,the oxidized iron ores that were loaded into the blast furnace had granulometries within 10 and 120 mm.However,the depletion of high grade iron ore sources has made necessary the utilization of concentration processes with the purpose of enriching the iron ore.Because of these processes,a fine granulometry is produced,and thus iron agglomeration.Pellets The Hira GroupIron Ore Pelletization is an agglomeration process of the disintegrated Iron Ore fines into Iron ore Pellet which is suitable for the utilization of downstream process of Iron Making.The Hira Process is the Ore ground to the required fineness through wet grinding process mainly by Ball Mills and the slurry is dewatered by pressure filtration.
