Cement is seldom used on its own,but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry,or with sand and gravel,produces concrete.Cement is the most widely used material in existence and is only behind water as the planet's mostconsumed resource.Working Safely With Concrete Portland Cement AssociationThe A B Cs of fresh concrete's effect on skin are: Abrasive Sand contained in fresh concrete is abrasive to bare skin.B asic & portland cement is alkaline in nature,so wet C austic concrete and other cement mixtures are strongly basic (pH of 12 to 13).Strong bases like strong acids are harmful,or caustic to skin.

## Energy Efficiency and Saving in the Cement Industry
Cement accounts for 83% of total energy use in the production of nonmetallic minerals and 94% of CO 2 emissions.Energy represents 20% to 40% of the total cost of cement production.The production of cement clinker from limestone and chalk by heating limestone to temperatures above 950&#176C is the main energy consuming process.Cement: Materials and manufacturing processA ball mill is a rotating drum filled with steel balls of different sizes (depending on the desired fineness of the cement) that crush and grind the clinker.Gypsum is added during the grinding process to provide means for controlling the setting of the cement.The cement is bagged transported for concrete production.
