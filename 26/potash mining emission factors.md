## Assessment of greenhouse gas mitigation options for …
The objective of this study is to investigate greenhouse gas mitigation pathways for the iron,gold,and potash mining sectors in Canada.These sectors have not widely accepted the available cleaner production strategies and so there is potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.NPI Emission Estimation Technique Manual for Miningmining occurs in horizontal tunnels with access to the surface via large vertical shafts.The main activities carried out at underground coal mines that could lead to emissions to air,water,and land,or transfers of NPI substances,are as follows:

## Environmental impact of mining
Environmental impacts of mining can occur at local,regional,and global scales through direct and indirect mining practices.Impacts can result in erosion,sinkholes,loss of biodiversity,or the contamination of soil,groundwater,and surface water by the chemicals emitted from mining processes.These processes also have an impact on the atmosphere from the emissions of carbon which have.Assessment of greenhouse gas mitigation options for the.GHG emissions are expected to increase by 1.3,1.4,and 1.5 in the iron,gold,and potash mining sectors.The increase is driven by growth in the sectors.Projected energy demand and GHG emission result tables for the iron,gold,and potash mining sub sectors are in Table A15 and Table A16,respectively,in the supplementary file.3.2.
