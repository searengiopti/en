## USE OF RED MUD AND IRON TAILINGS IN SELF.
Iron ore tailings are the materials left over after the beneficiation process of separating the valuable fraction from the worthless fraction of an iron ore.The various processes of beneficiation are crushing,screening,grinding,washing,jigging,cycloning,using magnetic separator etc.Even though left over iron ore tailing contains 20 30% ofPaste thickening optimizes tailings disposal and water.By Jim McMahon.Mine tailings disposal,and its impact on water usage,is an important concern for any mining company.The challenge today,whether extracting aluminum,zinc,gold or iron ore,is how to dispose of tailings material such that it is contained and stable,while maximizing water reuse and minimizing surface footprint.
