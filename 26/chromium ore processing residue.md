## Research Progress of Separation and Recovery of Chromium.
Chromite ore processing residue (COPR)is the heavy metal hazardous waste,but also is the important chromium containing secondary resource.Presently the treatment way for the chromite processing residue has the characteristics that the detoxification is.Biotreatment of chromite ore processing residue by.Chromite ore processing residues (COPR) is the source of the Cr(VI) contamination in the environment.Pannonibacter phragmitetus BB was used to treat two different types of COPRs in this research.The water soluble Cr(VI) of COPR A and B is 3,982.9 and 1,181.4 mg kg,respectively.In the column biotreatment process,P.phragmitetus BB can reduce Cr(VI) in the leachate to an undetectable level.
