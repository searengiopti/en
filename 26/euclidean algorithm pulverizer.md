## What are the Advantages of Using Euclid's Algorithm?
The Euclidean Algorithm is generally considered to be an extremely fast way to find the greatest common divisor of a pair of integers.In fact,the Indian mathematician,Aryabhata called it "the pulverizer." That being said,the algorithm operates slowly when.aryabhata remainder theorem: relevance to public. Springer Link1,2.t).The ART,which has much in common with the extended Euclidean algorithm.This method was called kuttaka,which literally means “pulverizer,” on.

## Code for Greatest Common Divisor in Python Stack Overflow
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number that divides both of them with no remainder.One way to find the GCD of two numbers is Euclid's algorithm,which is based on the observation that if r is the remainder when a is divided by b,then gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,r).Solved: Problem 1.(10 Points) Use The Pulverizer (extende.(10 Points) Use The Pulverizer (extended Euclidean Algorithm) To Express Gcd (1529,14039) As A Linear Combination Of 1529 And 14039.Show All Steps.This problem has been solved!
