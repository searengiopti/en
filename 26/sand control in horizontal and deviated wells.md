Jul 03,2017 · As operators continue to drill deeper wells in more remote offshore locations,the traditional wait and see approach to sand control is no longer an option in many cases.Operators have recognized that a proactive strategy is needed,and many are actually installing sand control equipment during the well's initial completion,rather than waiting to do so only when sand.Sand Control Alternatives for Horizontal WellsOne topic ofincreased debate is control of sand invasion into horizontal wells completed inunconsolidated formations.Most of the world's horizontal wells have beendrilled into something other than sandstone reservoirs,and only a smallpercentage have targeted truly unconsolidated formations.
