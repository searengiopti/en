## Copper in the USA: Copper Producers
Copper in the USA: Bright Future Glorious Past Copper Producers.At the beginning of copper's flow through the economy are the mining companies,which process vast quantities of low grade ore,mostly from open pit mines in order to produce copper.Approximately two tons of overburden must be removed along with each ton of copper.Copper Mining,Processing,Production & Mine Services.The project increased the overall processing capacity to 85,000 t d (an increase of over 30,000 t d) with annual copper production averaging 165 million pounds.Achieved over 1 million manhours without a lost time incident.Minimal interruption to existing production during plant shutdown.

## Copper extraction Wikipedia
Until the latter half of the 20th century,smelting sulfide ores was almost the sole means of producing copper metal from mined ores (primary copper production).Davenport,et al,noted in 2002 that even then 80% of global primary copper production was from copper.167 PROFILE ON THE PRODUCTION OF ELECTRIC WIRES &,PVC granules and copper wires are the major raw materials that are required by the plant Annual cost of raw material is estimated at Birr 7143 million All the raw materials have to be imported till they are produced locally The required raw materials and their corresponding costs at,
