In mining,the ore is extracted by drilling or blasting and then crushed and ground The ore is then treated using extractive metallurgy The Froth flotation process separates the Lead and other minerals from the waste rock (tailings) to form a concentrateHistory of lead mining Minerals and mines Foundations.The 19th century was a period which saw Cornish mining technology used to deepen some of the mines in search of richer ore deposits.However,as the lead veins narrow with depth,this proved unsuccessful,and attention was switched to resmelting the lead rich waste slag and slimes left over from previous medieval mining.
