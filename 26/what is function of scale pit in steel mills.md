The Hot Rolling Process The primary function of the Hot Strip Mill is to reheat semi finished steel slabs of steel nearly to their melting point,then roll them thinner and longer through 12 successive rolling mill stands driven by motors totaling 77,000 hp,and finally coiling up the lengthened steel sheet for transport to the next process.Everything you need to know about flatteners and levelers.Most lines use looping pits or flying shears with the leveler going slow then fast.Since levelers have a limited capacity range of about four times the maximum or minimum material thickness,it is common for two levelers—a big one and a smaller one—to be used in a cut to length line to extend capacity range.
