## Cyanide and removal options from effluents in gold …
Cyanide has been widely used as an essential raw material in several industries including textile,plastics,paints,photography,electroplating,agriculture,food,medicine and mining metallurgy.Because of its high affinity for gold and silver,cyanide is able to selectively leach these metals from ores.Cyanide Use in Gold MiningCyanide's efficiency makes mining more wasteful.Because cyanide leaching is very efficient,it allows profitable mining of much lower ore grades.Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold.Partially due to cyanide,modern mines are.much larger than before cyanide was used;
