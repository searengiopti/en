## The Advantages of Portland Limestone Cement ,
Portland limestone cement has a smaller carbon footprint with no drawbacks Log In or,or durability,why would we resist using it? We in the construction industry are justifiably cautious with new materials,but the evidence is in and there is no reason not to adopt portland limestone cements (PLC) with open arms,How does PLC affect.How Does Limestone Affect the Environment? ReferenceLimestone can be damaged by the environment through weather and water erosion.The stone absorbs water that can cause it to deteriorate over time.If the water has a high acidity content,the damage is more immediate.Wind can wear away stone detailing.Limestone is also prone to discoloration by exposure to oil,dyes or even organic material

## What Effect Does Acid Rain Have on the Environment.
Acid rain has many environmental side effects,but its impact is largely seen on water sources and aquatic environment,such as lakes,wetlands and streams,explains National Geographic.Acid rain reduces the alkalinity,the capacity of water to neutralize acid,and thus increases the acidity of the water,leading to a weaker ecosystem.Can neoprene be green or eco friendly? Seventhwave,Arguably the extraction of limestone has less of an impact on the environment than oil based neoprene,which depends on oil exploration,drilling,and potentially dangerous transportation (think oil spills)

Internet GeographyWeathering is the breakdown of rock by physical,chemical or biological processes.Limestone areas are predominantly affected by chemical weathering when rainwater,which contains a weak carbonic acid,reacts with limestone.This causes the limestone to dissolve.Carbon dioxide from the respiration of animals (and ourselves) is one cause of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
