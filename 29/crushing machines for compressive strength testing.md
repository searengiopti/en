## What is Compression Testing? Instron
Compression testing is one of the most fundamental types of mechanical testing,alongside tensile and flexion tests.Compression tests are used to determine a material's behavior under applied crushing loads,and are typically conducted by applying compressive pressure to a test specimen (usually of either a cuboid or cylindrical geometry) using platens or specialized fixtures on a universalCompression Test MachinesCompression Test machines are universal testing machines specially configured to evaluate static compressive strength characteristics of materials,products,and components.Choose from a wide variety of compression test machines that measure characteristics such as ultimate compression strength,yield strength,deflection and modulus.
