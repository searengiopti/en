## Uranium Mining Overview World Nuclear Association
Uranium Mining In the last fifty years uranium has become one of the world's most important energy minerals.It is used almost entirely for making electricity,though a small proportion is used for the important task of producing medical isotopes.Uranium is a chemical element with symbol U and atomic number 92.It is a silvery white metal in the actinide series of the periodic table.A uranium atom has 92.
