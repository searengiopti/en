You can define the stress strain behavior of plain concrete in uniaxial compression outside the elastic range.Compressive stress data are provided as a tabular function of inelastic (or crushing) strain,and,if desired,strain rate,temperature,and field variables.Positive (absolute) values should be given for the compressive stress and.Concrete damaged plasticityUnlike concrete models based on the smeared crack approach,the concrete damaged plasticity model does not have the notion of cracks developing at the material integration point.However,it is possible to introduce the concept of an effective crack direction with the purpose of obtaining a graphical visualization of the cracking patterns in the concrete structure.
