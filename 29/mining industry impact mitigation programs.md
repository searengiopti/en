## What is Mitigation? FEMA.gov
Mitigation is the effort to reduce loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.In order for mitigation to be effective we need to take action now—before the next disaster—to reduce human and financial consequences later (analyzing risk,reducing risk,and insuring against risk).Multiple Mining Risks PartnerReThe re insurance impact of un capped controlled values is disproportionately high for excess of loss reinsurance.And what does all this mean for re insurance? Due to the heavy risk exposures in mining,working closely with the insured's Risk Management department on risk mitigation is central to re insurance relationships in this sector.
