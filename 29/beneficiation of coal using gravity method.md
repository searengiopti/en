## Coal Beneficiation an overview ScienceDirect Topics
An overview of analytical methods used to determine inorganics in coal is given by Huggins (2002),and mineral matter in coal is presented in Chapter 2 of this book.A common method for determining whether a mineral or element will partition during beneficiation is through analysis of the float sink fractions for different size fractions.Coal Beneficiation Technology 2007 Initiatives,Policies,Coal Beneficiation Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both Two basic processes of beneficiation: Dry deshaling: Non coal or shaly coal is removed without using any liquid media
