## Underground Mining of Shallow Dipping Orebodies.
Many underground mining methods rely on blasted rock moving under gravity to report to extraction points.Mining of orebodies dipping between 20 45 degrees poses a unique challenge for mining engineers in that a dip angle in this range will not allow the movement of broken ore down the footwall to the mucking horizon.Countermeasure Method for Stope Instability in Crown.pillar thickness will increase crown pillar stability yet reduce mining recovery because part of crown pillar is formed by ore bodyPreventing.stope failure is the key to maintain stability and optimize recovery of crown pillar.Therefore,it is important to study countermeasure method for stope failure especially in crown pillar area.
