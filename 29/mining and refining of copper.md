## Copper Refining: Explained Step by Step
In refining copper,the metal is melted down in a reverberatory furnace in a more or less oxidizing atmosphere and then further subjected to an oxidizing smelting in order to eliminate the common impurities,most of which have a stronger affinity for oxygen than has copper.In these operations some of the copper is oxidized to cuprous oxide and dissolved by the metal bath.How copper is produced Mining For ZambiaThe concentrate is then purified further through a refining process.The copper is now nearly 99.99% pure,and is cast into distinct shapes,ready for shipping to&nbsp;.
