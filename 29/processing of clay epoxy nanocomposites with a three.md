Sep 12,2018&#0183;&#32;Nanoclays have evoked a great deal of attention lately for the preparation of novel nanocomposite materials for several applications This is attributed to their lamellar structures,which are distinguished by having high in plane strength and stiffness,as well as a high aspect ratio Nanocomposites have exhibited an advanced gas and water barrier properties compared to the,1 IntroductionLike most epoxy nanocomposites actually presenting an intercalated structure,it is not surprising that most studies have shown that there was a reduction in T g However,different concentrations of curing agent and various methods for obtaining these nanocomposites,as well as the type of clay used,directly influence the results
