## Iron Ore Today's Spot Price & Charts Market Index
Iron Ore (Fe) is mined in around 50 countries worldwide and used to make steel (buildings,cars,white goods etc.).Global economic growth is the primary factor that drives its supply and demand.When economies are growing,the need for steel in construction increases which drives the price up.Iron and Manganese Ore Deposits: Mineralogy.The majority of ore deposits of both iron and manganese are of sedimentary origin.At present,high grade iron ore deposits formed by hydrothermal and supergene enrichment of Proterozoic banded iron formations constitute the most important source for iron ores,with only some magmatic and skarn type iron ore deposits being mined.
