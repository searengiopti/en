## Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) Civil Engineering Laboratory
The standard aggregate impact test shall be made on aggregate passing a 14.0 mm BS test sieve and retained on a10.0 mm BS test sieve.If required,or if the standard size is not available,smaller sizes may be tested but owing to the non homogeneity of aggregates the results are not likely to be the same as those obtained from the standard size.How to Find Aggregate Crushing Value and Its Test Procedure?The aggregate crushing value test is a useful guide when dealing with aggregates of unknown performance,particularly when lower strength is suspected.To find out the performance of aggregates for various uses,7 types of lab test are available.Also Read: Impact Test of Aggregates.
