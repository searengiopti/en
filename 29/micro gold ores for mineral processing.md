## Bioleaching Wikipedia
Bioleaching is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms.This is much cleaner than the traditional heap leaching using cyanide.Bioleaching is one of several applications within biohydrometallurgy and several methods are used to recover copper,zinc,lead,arsenic,antimony,nickel,molybdenum,gold,silver,and cobaltcnkiThe native Au can be divided into two kinds of grain and micrograin gold.""""。 The secondary action of micrograin gold usually forms the carlintype Audeposit or lateritic and gossan Au deposit."",。
