## Ball Mill Design Power Calculation
The basic parameters used in ball mill design (power calculations),rod mill or any tumbling mill sizing are; material to be ground,characteristics,Bond Work Index,bulk density,specific density,desired mill tonnage capacity DTPH,operating % solids or pulp density,feed size as F80 and maximum ‘chunk size’,product size as P80 and maximum and finally the type of circuit open closed.SAGMILLING.COM.:.Mill Critical Speed DeterminationMill Critical Speed Determination.The "Critical Speed" for a grinding mill is defined as the rotational speed where centrifugal forces equal gravitational forces at the mill shell's inside surface.This is the rotational speed where balls will not fall away from the mill's shell.

With miniature tooling and or certain materials the speed calculation sometimes yields an unrealistic spindle speed.For example,a.047” cutter in 6061 aluminum (SFM 1,000) would return a speed of ~81,000 RPM.Since this speed is only attainable with high speed air spindles,the full SFM of 1,000 may not be achievable.Ball MillThe ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.
