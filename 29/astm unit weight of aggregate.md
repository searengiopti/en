## Standard Test Method for The Determination of Bulk Density.
The bulk density is more in compacted state as compared to the loose which shows that the bulk density greatly depends on the degree of compaction or how densely it is packed.; Usually increase in bulk density should be above 15% for coarse aggregate and should be below 15% for fine aggregate,But in our results it is 11.20% for fine aggregate and 11.48% for coarse aggregate.TIP 9 Density of Structural Lightweight ConcreteASTM C567 is the standard test method for determining the density of structural lightweight concrete in various conditions and the relationships between them.ASTM C567 provides procedures for determining the freshly mixed concrete density,equilibrium.

## ASTM C138 Density (Unit Weight),Yield,and Air Content.
Divide the weight of concrete by the known volume (3) (4) = density,or fresh unit weight.There are a few unique procedures listed in the ASTM C138 to remember.If < 1" = Must use vibrator capable of at least 9,000 vibrations per minute.If 1" 3" = Can use vibrator or tamping rod.If > 3" = Can't use vibrator,only use tamping rod.Unit Weight of Aggregates Weight DensityThe unit weight of a material can be defined as the weight of a given volume of graded aggregate.It effectively measures the volume that the graded aggregate will occupy and includes both solid particles and the voids between them.The unit weight of fine and coarse aggregates within the ASTM grading limits are generally in the range of 1450 1750 kg cu.m.The unit weight values are used.
