## Glad You Asked: Igneous,Sedimentary,& Metamorphic Rocks.
Some common sedimentary rocks are shale,sandstone,limestone,and conglomerate.Shale: Shale is lithified clay and consists of layers that typically break into thin sheets.A well known shale formation is the Wheeler Shale of the House Range,Millard County,which contains numerous Cambrian Period (500 to 570 million years ago) trilobite.Which do you think will weather at a faster rate.Sandstone will weather faster than granite.We classify sandstone as sedimentary rock,this means that the rock is composed of sand sized minerals or rocks that have been "smooshed" (that's a science term) together.These grains of rock are very loosely compacted in comparison to other rocks.
