## Advanced Methods of Concrete Mixture Design
In 1907,Fuller proposed the formula for maximum density gradation: P i = 100 (d i D) 0.45,where P i = % passing sieve size d i,and D = maximum size of aggregate.In the 1960s,the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) came up with the ‘0.45 power’ gradation chart for aggregates in concrete …Item 421 Hydraulic Cement Concrete the Texas Department…Property.Test Method.Limits.Compressive strength,min % control at 7 days.Alternatively to the above equation,blend fine aggregate with a micro deval.use the maximum cement alkali content reported on the cement mill certificate.
