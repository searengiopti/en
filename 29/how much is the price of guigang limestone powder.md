Limestone has two origins: (1) biogenic precipitation from seawater,the primary agents being lime secreting organisms and foraminifera; and (2) mechanical transport and deposition of preexisting limestones,forming clastic deposits.Travertine,tufa,caliche,chalk,sparite,and micrite are all varieties of limestone.Limestone has long fascinated earth scientists because of its rich fossil.International survey on eco innovation parksBetween 2004 and 2005 when the fuel oil price increased significantly,four firms specialised in the wood and cogeneration sector decided to substitute the previous energy supply with alternative solutions.Since the end of 2006,a collective cogeneration plant burning wood wastes supplies the companies with heat and electricity.
