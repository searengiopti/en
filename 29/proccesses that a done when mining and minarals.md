## Sulfide Mining,Mining Methods,Techniques,Copper,Zinc.
Mining is the method of tacking materials from the earth to get valuable metal ores like copper,zinc,and lead,which are known as target minerals in mining terms.Metal ores like copper,zinc and lead are minute quantities contrasted to the whole composition of the earth.Mining Operation: Types,Impacts and Remedial MeasuresRegarding underground mining there are five processes.They are: Slope mining process: A type of underground mining,slopes are made into the ground and the desired material is accessed.This is done when the minerals are located far enough and surface mining cannot be employed to reach it.Generally,coal is mined in this way.Hard rock process:

## Mineral Extraction
Mineral extraction sites,which include strip mines,quarries,and underground mines,contribute to surface water and groundwater pollution,erosion,and sedimentation (see Chapter 14).The mining process involves the excavation of large amounts of waste rock in order to remove the desired mineral ore (Fig.12.6).The ore is then crushed into.Froth Flotation ProcessThe Froth Flotation Process is about taking advantage of the natural hydrophobicity of liberated (well ground) minerals metals and making playing on making them hydrophobic (water repel) individually to carefully separate them from one another and the slurry they are in.For this purpose we use chemicals reagents: Frothers (MIBC) is what allows the formation of air bubbles.
