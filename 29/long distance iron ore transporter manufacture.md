Today,2.4 km long trains,monitored remotely from an operations centre in Perth,travel across a network of 1,700 km of track,delivering iron ore from 16 mines to ports in Dampier and Cape Lambert in Western Australia.These trains have now safely travelled more than 4.5 million kilometres autonomously since they were first deployed last year.Rio Tinto makes Australia's first. The West AustralianIron ore chief executive Chris Salisbury said the successful pilot run put the company on track to meet its goal of operating the world's first fully autonomous heavy haul,long distance rail network,which would unlock significant safety and productivity benefits for the business.
