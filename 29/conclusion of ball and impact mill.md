Purpose The article reports a wet milling process,where the planetary ball mill was combined with pearl milling technology to reach nanosize range of meloxicam (Mel; 100 500 nm).Particle Size Reduction Studies on the Lab and Commercial. · The screen quality of the low energy mill was shown to have a significant impact on the throughput and the milled polymer pellet PSD.Compared to the low energy mill,the impact mill (i.e.high energy mill) is less dependent on screen quality,had lower screen temperatures,and ultimately is the first choice for polymer pellets milling.

Ball Mills.Ball mills operate by introducing the material to be milled into a rotating vessel which contains grinding media (e.g.high density balls or rods) and the material is ground by attrition through the tumbling action of the mill.Practical 1 : Ball Milling TF Lab 1 · In roller mills,the principle of attrition is used where material is sheared as it passes through a gap and is transferred from slower roll to a faster roll,and is removed by a scraper.In ball mill,size reduction is done by both impact and attrition of particles.Rod mill is similar to ball mills but it uses long rods for grinding media.
