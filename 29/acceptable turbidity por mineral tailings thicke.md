The active por­tion of this anti exotoxin and antimycotoxin contains the amino acid methionine,which includes a C S C linkage.When chelated by the hydroxyl radical (one of the MOBS oxidants),methionine's central sulfur atom acquires one or two oxygen atoms.What is the maximum permissible level (MPL) of turbidity.The answer to your question depends on the type of water you are treating; consequently,in the U.S.A turbidity is regulated as a "treatment technique",and depends on whether you are treating.
