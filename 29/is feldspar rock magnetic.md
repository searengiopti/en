## The Density of Common Rocks and Minerals ThoughtCo
Jan 23,2020 · Rock density is very sensitive to the minerals that compose a particular rock type.Sedimentary rocks (and granite),which are rich in quartz and feldspar,tend to be less dense than volcanic rocks.And if you know your igneous petrology,you will see that the more mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) a rock is,the greater its density.Discover Rock Forming MineralsA handful of very abundant minerals account for the great majority of the Earth&#39s rocks including feldspar and calcite.
