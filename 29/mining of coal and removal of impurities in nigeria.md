## Coal prices and outlook
The higher cost of coal from underground mines reflects the more difficult mining conditions and the need for more miners.When coal is burned,it releases impurities that can combine with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide (SO2).When SO2 combines with moisture in the atmosphere,it produces acid rain that can harm forests and lakes.Breaker boy WikipediaA breaker boy was a coal mining worker in the United States and United Kingdom whose job was to separate impurities from coal by hand in a coal breaker.Although breaker boys were primarily children,elderly coal miners who could no longer work in the mines because of age,disease,or accident were also sometimes employed as breaker boys.The use of breaker boys began in the mid 1860s.

## Mining industry of Nigeria
Mining is the extraction[removal]of minerals and metals from the earth; the Nigerian Coal Corporation (NCC) is a parastatal corporation that was formed in 1950 and held a monopoly on the mining,processing,and sales of coal,lignite,and coke products until 1999.Coal was first discovered in Enugu in 1909 at the Udi Ridge in Enugu,This was found by a British mine Engineer known as Albert.Tail Gas (Fossil Energy) Equipment near Nigeria …Traces of impurities are present in raw biogas.Removal of these impurities (such as water vapour,CO2 and H2S) and getting clean biogas is essential prior to using as fuel for various applications.Gas cleaning systems offered include H2S Scrubber and CO2 removal.

## Appendix E: Coal Mining and Processing Methods Coal.
In surface mining,the ground covering the coal seam (the overburden) is first removed to expose the coal seam for extraction.The elements of a surface mining operation are (1) topsoil removal and storage for later use,(2) drilling and blasting the strata overlying the coal seam,(3) loading and transporting this fragmented overburden material (called spoil),(4) drilling and blasting the.Water for Coal Union of Concerned ScientistsDepending on its quality,coal may need to be "washed" with water and chemicals to remove sulfur and impurities before it can be burned in a power plant.According to the US Department of Energy,total water used for coal mining in the United States (including water use for coal washing and cooling of drilling equipment) ranges from 70.
