## Carbon in pulp Wikipedia
Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.Introduced in the early 1980s,Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process.As such it is used in most industrial applications where the presence of competing silver or copper does not prohibit its use.The process design of gold leaching and carbon in pulp.Assuming that a gold ore has been effectively ground to ensure maximum economic liberation of gold,the circuits that will have the most effect on the successful operation of a gold plant will be that of the leaching and carbon in pulp circuit (CIP).The reagent and utilities operating costs associated with leaching,adsorption,elution and.
