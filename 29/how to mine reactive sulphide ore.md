The most common are known as sulfide ores in which the copper is chemically bonded with sulfur.Others are known as oxide ores,carbonate ores,or mixed ores depending on the chemicals present.Many copper ores also contain significant quantities of gold,silver,nickel,and other valuable metals,as well as large quantities of commercially.Energy and Environmental Profile of the U.S.Mining.Energy and Environmental Profile of the U.S.Mining Industry 5.1 Process Overview 5.1.1 Copper Ore Mining Copper is commonly extracted from surface,underground and increasingly,from in situ operations.In 2000,the principal mining States,in descending order,Arizona,Utah,New Mexico,and Montana,accounted for 99 percent of domestic.

## Sulfide Mining in Michigan's U.P.
SULFIDE MINING (Also called Hardrock Mining) Sulfide mining is very different from the Iron Mining that occurs in the Negaunee Ishpeming Tilden and Empire mines and in the Keweenaw Copper Mines.The mining that is proposed on the Yellow Dog Plains and in other areas in the western U.P.deals with minerals that are imbedded in sulfide ores.2014 OPEN ACCESS minerals2014 7 8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mine tailings are among the largest mining wastes on Earth and can reach surface areas of up to 52 km2 [1] and be several hundred meters high.As this waste type results mainly from the flotation process of sulphide mineral ores they are very likely to produce acid mine drainage (AMD),the main environmental problem of contemporary mining activity.

Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery ofMining 101.1: Acid Mine DrainageCrushing the ore to remove it from the mine increases its surface area and thus its reactive potential.It is necessary to break up rocks in all mining types from open pit to underground.Table 1: List of common ‘pyrite type’ sulphide minerals capable of contributing to AMD (Obreque Contreras,et al.2015)

Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Roasting (metallurgy) WikipediaRoasting is a process of heating of sulfide ore to a high temperature in presence of air.It is a step of the processing of certain ores.More specifically,roasting is a metallurgical process involving gas solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s).Often before roasting,the ore has already been partially purified,e.g.by froth flotation.

## How is sulfur extracted from its ores? Quora
 · There are no (or very little) sulfur ores,at least today.The main source is the purification process of natural gas and oil : the sulfur is converted into H2S and part of it is burned into SO2 which then react with H2S : SO2 + 2 H2S → 3 S + 2 H2.Processing gold sulphide ore Gold Refining ForumApr 14,2014 · If your processing a high sulphide content gold ore this will not work.With high sulphide gold ore break it down and seperate it till all you see is the yellow shiny stuff then take that and put it into a hydrocloric acid solution and let it sit for a week or so swirling it in bottom of container occasionally.
