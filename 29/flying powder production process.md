Metal injection moulding (MIM) is a development of the traditional powder metallurgy (PM) process and is rightly regarded as a branch of that technology.The standard PM process is to compact a lubricated powder mix in a rigid die by uniaxial pressure,eject the compact from the die,and sinter it.Compaction of ceramic powders WikipediaIt is a well established fact that the performance of a ceramic component critically depends on the manufacturing process.In particular,initial powder characteristics and processing,including cold forming and sintering,have a strong impact on the mechanical properties of the components as they may generate a defect population (microcracks,density gradients,pores,agglomerates) within the.
