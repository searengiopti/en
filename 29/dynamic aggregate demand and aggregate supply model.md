## Week 8 Discussion.docx Utilize the dynamic aggregate.
Utilize the dynamic aggregate demand and aggregate supply model animations and videos in MyEconLab to analyze the macroeconomic factors that led to the 2007 2009 recession.How were GDP,inflation,and unemployment affected during the recession,and how does the model show this? What monetary policies and fiscal policies were implemented.Journal of Applied Mathematics hindawi.comThis paper aims to connect the bridge between analytical results and the use of the computer for numerical simulations in economics.We address the analytical properties of a simple dynamic aggregate demand and aggregate supply (AD AS) model and solve it numerically.
