## Refining Beryllium Ore The Elements Unearthed
 · Refining Beryllium Ore.With only 0.65 % beryllium oxide (or 4.5 lbs.per ton of beryllium) in the final ore,a process had to be engineered to economically concentrate the beryllium for final processing.The properties that make beryllium useful also make it difficult to extract from its ores.Beryllium Extraction and BeneficiationAnalysis of beryllium ore products is rather difficult and tedious.This can be accomplished spectographically or chemically,the later preferable by fluorometric methods.BeO analyses currently cost $15.00 per determination so laboratory work on the recovery of this mineral is still rather expensive.
