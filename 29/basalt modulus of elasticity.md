## Units of Modulus of Elasticity (Young's Modulus.
The units of modulus of elasticity are pressure units,as it is defined as stress (pressure units) divided by strain (dimensionless).Most commonly the units are Pascals (Pa) which is the SI unit,or pounds per square inch (psi) depending on the industry or geographical location.In Europe,Pa is most common,in the USA,psi is the more common.Ultimate tensile strength (UTS),often shortened to tensile strength (TS) or ultimate strength,is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending.
