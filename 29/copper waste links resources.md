## The Importance of Copper Recycling
Dec 10,2019&#0183;&#32;As with other metals,there are significant environmental benefits to the recycling of copper These include solid waste diversion,reduced energy requirements for processing,and natural resource conservation For example,the energy requirements of recycled copper are as much as 85 to 90% less than the processing of new copper from virgin oreWaste: a problem or a resource? — European …Waste is not only an environmental problem,but also an economic loss.On average Europeans produce 481 kilogrammes of municipal waste per year.An increasing share of this is recycled or composted,and less is sent to landfill.How can we change the way we produce and consume so as to produce less and less waste,while using all waste as a resource?
