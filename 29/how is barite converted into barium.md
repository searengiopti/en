## Barite (BARIUM) Altervista
Barite (BARIUM) Introduction Barite is a mineral composed of barium sulfate,BaSO 4.It is usually colorless or milky white,but can be almost any color,depending on the impurities trapped in the crystals during their formation.Barite is relatively soft,measuring 3 3.5 on Moh's scale of hardness.It is unusually heavy for a non metallic.Leading Exporters Of Barium Salts,Barytes,And Witherite.Since baryte is highly impure and has contaminants,such as waste rock and other minerals,it is processed after being mined.The baryte is separated from these contaminants by gravity separation,wet grinding and froth flotation.Then the baryte is dried.Baryte is turned into barium sulphate by the process of carbothermal&nbsp;.
