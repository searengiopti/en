## Leaching Guide of Refractory Gold Ore
1.What Is Refractory Gold Ore? With the development of beneficiation technology,the definition of refractory gold ore is changing.Generally speaking,refractory gold ore in leaching field is a kind of ore whose leaching rate of gold is less than 80% when directly processed by cyanidation after find grinding.Diagnostic Leaching for Refractory Gold OresA diagnostic leach test can be very useful to qualitatively assess how gold occurs within the ore and the extent to which it may be refractory.Several different permutations of diagnostic leach tests depend on specific objectives,but they generally involve the sequential leaching of a gold ore sample with progressively stronger reagents,producing a qualitative assessment of the gold.
