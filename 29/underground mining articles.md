## Underground Mining for Meeting Environmental …
Underground mining can be considered to be more acceptable than surface mining from environmental and social perspectives since,it often has a smaller footprint than an open pit of comparable capacity.The main advantage of underground mining compared to surface mining is that in general only the ore is extracted and waste rock is left behind.1.1 PHASES OF A MINING PROJECT ELAW201924&ensp&#0183&enspAlthough underground mining is a less environmentallydestructive means of gaining access to an ore deposit,it is often more costly and entails greater safety risks than strip mining,including openpit mining.While most largescale mining projects involve openpit mining,many large underground mines are in operation around the world.1.1.3
