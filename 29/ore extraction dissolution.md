## Extraction of gold using cyanide
Extraction of gold using cyanide Gold is found in very low concentrations in the ore from which it is mined.To collect the gold from the ore it needs to be separated from the other minerals in the ore.To do this the gold needs to be made into a soluble form so that it can be separated from the other minerals as gold is insoluble.Sulphuric acid pressure leaching of laterites ScienceDirectAs illustrated in Fig.1,at 250°C,30% solids and acid ore ratio of 0.4,the Ni extraction is complete after 45 min of leaching and the terminal concentration of free sulphuric acid is 0.56 mol L.This time is longer than the 30 min required to complete the dissolution of Ni in the case of a limonitic feed under the same temperature and pulp density (acid ore ratio of 0.2),although the.
