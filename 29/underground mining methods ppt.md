Abstract.Selection of the underground mining method in hard rock mines is one of the most important decisions that should be made by mining professional.To carry out extraction from a mineral body,selecting a proper underground stoping method is especially vital in terms of the techno economic parameters.Underground Mining MethodsThe choice of an underground mining method depends on a range of factors and these include; the size and shape of the deposit,the orientation or slope of the deposit,the depth of the deposit,geological structures,characteristics of the ore and the surrounding rocks and issues with gas and water In combination,these factors allow us to determine an appropriate arrangement and sequence for.

## Cost of Stoping for Underground Mining
Stoping cost is one of the largest of the items comprising the total cost of producing ore The cost per ton of ore mined is important but may be overemphasized if the more important cost,that per unit of metal recovered,is thereby overlooked A given stoping method may give a low cost per ton of ore but,by reason of high dilution involving the handling,hauling,hoisting,and treating of a.Lecture 10 Mineral Resources and Mining s.pptDrill cores,though expensive,can be used to determine underground extent of ore.Estimate the mass of the commodity: = volume of ore body x density of ore body x grade).1 metric ton = "tonne" is 1000 kilograms.Design a profitable plan for mining.Selecting appropriate mining techniques are just a small part of it!
