## (DOC) VAT LEACHING AND ELUTION PLANT GOLD PROCESSING.
The manual is all about VAT Leaching Technology which is a low cost technology for recovery of gold from fresh ore or from tails left from previous CIL process and from Small Scale Miners.Gold Carbon In Leach Plant Updated January,2017It also gives much more control over the process that a conventional CIL plant without a thickener.The CIL process is viable if there is sufficient gold content,carbonates clays in the ore which will "rob" some gold in solution,and it leaches in 8 13 hours.A Stainless Steel Cathode from the electrowinning cell in the gold.
