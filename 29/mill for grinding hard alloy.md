## Burr mill Wikipedia
A burr mill,or burr grinder,is a mill used to grind hard,small food products between two revolving abrasive surfaces separated by a distance usually set by the user.When the two surfaces are set far apart,the resulting ground material is coarser,and when the two surfaces are set closer together,the resulting ground material is finer and smaller.How it Works: Crushers,Grinding Mills and Pulverizers.Crushers,grinding mills and pulverizers are types of grinding equipment used to transform or reduce a coarse material such as stone,coal,or slag into a smaller,finer material.Grinding equipment can be classified into to two basic types,crushers and grinders.
