## Coal fired power station Wikipedia
A coal fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity.Coal fired power stations generate over a third of the world's electricity but cause hundreds of thousands of early deaths each year,mainly from air pollution.A coal fired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station.The coal.Pulverised coal combustion (PCC) IEA Clean Coal CentreIncreasing thermal efficiency has the potential for reducing other emissions per MWe generated,such as those of SO2 and NOx.Where the coal cost is high,as where traded coals are used,increasing thermal efficiency can result in reduced overall costs in new plants for power generation,as less fuel is needed.

## CoalFired Thermal Power Plant an overview
Coal is the dominating fuel source used in thermal power plants for generation of electricity.At the coalfired thermal power plants,the raw coal is first pulverized to the shape of flour before it is forcefed to the furnace.During the pulverization process,the clay particles entrapped in the cracks of coal get separated from the coal.POLLUTANTS THERMAL PLANTS PowerDesulphurisation plants downstream of the boilers also reduce emissions.Fluidized bed combustion of coal is another effective method to reduce SO 2 emissions Ash: Ash is the residue after the combustion.A 500 MW coal fired power plant burning Coal with around 20 % Ash,collects ash to the tune of Two Million Tons in Five years.
