## Iron formation
Iron formation ores include primary and enriched varieties.Primary magnetite rich ores are generally lower grade (&lt;40 wt% Fe total) but have larger combined resources and reserves compared with enriched ores that have grades of 40 to 72 wt% Fe total.Enriched ores include early hypogene (magnetite,crystalline hematite) and later supergene (goethite hematite) ore types.Iron isotope fractionation during hydrothermal ore.Iron isotopes fractionate during hydrothermal processes.Therefore,the Fe isotope composition of ore forming minerals characterizes either iron sources or fluid histories.The former potentially serves to distinguish between sedimentary,magmatic or metamorphic iron sources,and the latter allows the reconstruction of precipitation and redox processes.These processes take place during ore.

The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process.The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace.These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.ORE DEPOSIT TYPES AND THEIR PRIMARY EXPRESSIONS.with such processes as addition of components by contamination,phase separation,cooling across a temperature gradient,pressure decrease,ﬂuid mixing and reaction with host rocks.A large variety of geological processes can meet the essential requirements for ore deposit formation and the concentration of ore
