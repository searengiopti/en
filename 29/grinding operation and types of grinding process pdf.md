## Chapter 17: Cutting Tool Applications — Grinding Methods.
Grinding,or abrasive machining,once performed on conventional milling machines,lathes and shapers,are now performed on various types of grinding machines.Grinding machines have advanced in design,construction,rigidity and application far more in the last decade than any other standard machine.Grinding Operation an overview ScienceDirect TopicsFigure 1.3 illustrates a typical reciprocating grinding operation.The five main elements are the grinding wheel,the workpiece,the grinding fluid,the atmosphere,and the grinding swarf.The grinding wheel performs the machining of the workpiece,although there is also an inevitable reverse process.The workpiece wears the grinding wheel.
