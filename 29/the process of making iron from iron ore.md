## Pig Iron Manufacturing Process
Mar 20,2017&#0183;&#32;Pig Iron At the beginning of the use of the electric furnace,for the manufacture of calcium carbide and ferro alloys,experimental work was conducted in it upon the production of steel from iron ore For many years steel and wrought iron have been produced directly from ore on a small scale in the forge,crucible,and reverberatory furnaces.Iron ore pelletizingThis process generates iron ore filter cake which needs to be pelletized to be used in the steel making process.Also during the processing of high grade iron.

## How iron is made material,manufacture,making,history,
Answer: Essentially it is necessary to reduce iron oxide to yield iron in metallic form In traditional manner this is done through reduction and consequent melting of iron in a blast furnace But in this process there is an excess of carbon in overall environment As such lot of it will also dis.A Look at the Process of Pelletizing Iron Ore for Steel.This process varies depending on the ore source,but typically involves various stages of crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the iron ore.Separation techniques such as magnetic separation or froth flotation are then used to separate the gangue (unwanted) materials from the iron content.
