Gravel pits,quarries and aggregate crushing and processing operations can generate significant amounts of fine particulate matter dust,both from the aggregate processing operations as well as fugitive dust from the internal traffic areas and exposed windblown areas.Mechanical screening WikipediaMechanical screening,often just called screening,is the practice of taking granulated ore material and separating it into multiple grades by particle size.This practice occurs in a variety of industries such as mining and mineral processing,agriculture,pharmaceutical,food,plastics,and recycling.[A method of separating solid particles according to size alone is called screening]
