## Copper ores Danafloat
The main copper sulphide minerals are chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) chalcocite (Cu2S),covellite (CuS),bornite (Cu5FeS4),tetrahedrite ((Cu,Fe)12Sb4S13) and enargite (Cu3AsS4).The largest source of copper is from porphyry ore deposits in which one or a combination of the aforementioned minerals occurs.Copper Refining: From Ore to Market Investing News NetworkIn pyrometallurgy,copper concentrate is dried before being heated in a furnace.Chemical reactions that occur during the heating process cause the concentrate to segregate into two layers of material: a matte layer and a slag layer.The matte layer,on the bottom,contains the copper,while the slag layer,on the top,contains the impurities.
