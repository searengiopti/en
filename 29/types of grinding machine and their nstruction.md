## Grinding Machines
Grinding machines,like broaching machines,operate over a range of speeds depending on the type of machine being used.These range from approximately 1250 to 2000m min −1,although in high speed grinding speeds of up to 5400m min are achievable (Schey,1987).The two most common grinding applications are cylindrical grinding and surface grinding.1.Grinding 1.1.Grinding and Abrasive MachinesFig.Types of surface grinding machines Tool and cutter grinder In grinding tools by hand a bench or pedastal type of grinder is used.The tool is hand held and moved across the face of the wheel continually to avoid excessive grinding in one spot.For sharpening miscellananeus cutters a universal type grinder is used.2.Types of Grinding.
