## Metal Profile: Chromium Properties,History & More
Chromium metal is most widely recognized for its use in chromium plating (which is often referred to simply as 'chrome'),but its largest use is as an ingredient in stainless steels.Both applications benefit from chromium's hardness,resistance to corrosion,and ability to be polished for a lustrous appearance.Chromium (Cr) Toxicity: Where Is Chromium Found? ATSDR.Coal and oil combustion contribute an estimated 1,723 metric tons of chromium per year in atmospheric emissions; however,only 0.2% of this chromium is Cr(VI).In contrast,chrome plating sources are estimated to contribute 700 metric tons of chromium per year to atmospheric pollution,100% of which is believed to be Cr(VI) [ATSDR 2000].
