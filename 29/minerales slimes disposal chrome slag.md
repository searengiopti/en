## WO2011141297A1 Lithium bearing slag as aggregate in.
This invention concerns the use of lithium bearing additives in concrete or mortar.Such additives are obtainable by a high temperature process wherein lithium bearing materials such as scrapped lithium ion batteries are smelted.More particularly,lithium bearing metallurgical slag is presented as an additive for reducing the undesired ASR (alkali silica reaction) in concrete or mortar.Problems in the mining industry in South africa ECDPMThe current turbulence in the mining industry in South Africa has its roots in several different factors.First,the fall in global demand for platinum and other minerals due to recession second,the consequences of the Marikana disaster in destabilising labour relations and third,the structural character of our mining industry.A great deal has been written about the first two factors,so
