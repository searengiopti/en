## Division of Geology and Mineral Resources Feldspar
Feldspar is one of the most abundant minerals in the earth's crust.The feldspars include a range of compositions with a general chemical formula of xAl(Al,Si) 3 O 8 where x can be sodium (Na) and or calcium (Ca) and or potassium (K).They are primarily used in glass and ceramics making.extraction of feldsparFeldspar is a kind of silicate minerals which contains calcium,sodium and potassium,there are many categories of Feldspar including albite,anorthite,etc.Feldspar mining process mainly applying flotation process,and Feldspar mining machines mainly including jaw crusher,ball mill,spiral chute,and concentrating table,etc.
