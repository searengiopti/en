## A discussion on the measurement of grinding media wear.
A material's susceptibility to wear depends on its physical and mechanical properties as well as on environmental factors,i.e.the conditions to which the material is exposed.In other words,the wear is a function of the tribosystem (),which is made up of four elements: body,counterbody,interfacial element and environment.The action of each one of these elements can vary,as well as the.Industrial Ball Mills: Steel Ball Mills and Lined Ball.Ball Mills Steel Ball Mills &amp; Lined Ball Mills.Particle size reduction of materials in a ball mill with the presence of metallic balls or other media dates back to the late 1800’s.The basic construction of a ball mill is a cylindrical container with journals at its axis.

## Testwork: Bond abrasion index SAGMILLING.COM
The Bond Abrasion Index is a measure of how readily a rock sample will wear away steel that comes into contact with it.It is conventionally used to estimate the liner and media wear rate in rod mills,ball mills and crushers.This is a batch test and returns a result in units of grams (the amount of metal that wears off the test coupon).Rod mills,how they functionRod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and broken and worn rods must be removed.
