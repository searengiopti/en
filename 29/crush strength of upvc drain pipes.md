Jul 02,2015 · It has lower strength and lower working temperature than UPVC pipes.Chlorinated PVC (CPVC) pipes which can withstand higher temperatures upto 120 0 (used to carry hot water) For pipes used in soil and waste water discharge systems,the thickness of the wall will be larger than that of used for roof drainage.Schedule 40 PVC vs Schedule 80 PVC What's the Difference?Inside Diameter of Schedule 40 vs Schedule 80.If the pipe were the same color,it would be difficult to tell the difference from the outside.In fact,both schedule 40 and schedule 80 PVC pipe have the same outside diameters.So a 1" size sch 40 PVC pipe has the same O.D.as a 1" sch 80 PVC pipe.

Different types of pipes are used for underground drains construction.The properties of these pipes and type of drainage required decides the selection of pipes.Underground drain pipes are subjected to various types of chemical and physical attacks,so these must be kept in mind during their selection.The Differences Between UPVC & PVC Pipes Hunker · In much of the world except the United States,uPVC is used more widely for water pipes than PVC.The extra materials give uPVC superior resistance to chemical erosion,and its smooth inner walls allow water to flow more smoothly with less turbulence.uPVC is also resistant to a wider range of temperatures than PVC.
