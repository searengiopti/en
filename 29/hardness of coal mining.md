## Anthracite Coal Characteristics and Applications
Anthracite coal,mined from the planet's oldest geological formations,has spent the longest time underground.The coal has been subjected to the most pressure and heat,making it the most compressed and hardest coal available.Hard coal contains greater potential to produce heat energy than softer,geologically "newer" coal.Germany the voice of coal in EuropeGermany has considerable reserves of hard coal and lignite,making these the country's most important indigenous sources of energy.However,in the case of hard coal,there remain only approximately 20 million tonnes to be extracted following the political decision to end subsidised German hard coal production in 2018.
