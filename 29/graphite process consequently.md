Density: Crystallographically perfect graphite has a density of 2.265 g cm3.Density can give a measure of crystal perfection and in practice,synthetic graphite rarely exhibits a density above 2.0 g cm3 with some versions as low as 1.6 g cm3.The density of synthetic graphite is directly related to the pore size and decreasing the particle size,or grain,reduces the relative porosity.University of Minnesota's Mineral Pages: GraphiteConsequently graphite is also used in the production of electrodes and generator brushes.Its crystal structure allows graphite to be used in ways that initially appear to be contradictory to one another.Graphite is prized for both its strength and weakness.

## Cast iron tec science
If only the range of the phase diagram above a carbon content of 2.06 % is considered,the fundamental difference between steels and cast iron in the solidification process becomes apparent.At a carbon concentration of less than 2.06 %,the steel initially solidified as solid solution (homogeneous austenite microstructure) within the typical lens shaped crystallization range in the state.Flake graphite cast iron Giesserei LexikonFlake graphite cast iron is predominantly produced with pearlitic structures,with the classification of grades being primarily determined by the graphite quantity and graphite shape and thus eventually by the carbon content.The higher the carbon content,the higher the graphite content in cast iron and the lower the strength values.
