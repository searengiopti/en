## Non Ferrous Mining and Metals Lhoist Minerals and lime.
Non Ferrous Mining and Metals.Lime products play a key role in the mining and extraction of non ferrous metals,including aluminum,copper,gold,nickel,cobalt,uranium,titanium and lithium.Playing a key role in controlling the cyanidation leaching process,lime increases the pH to an effective and safe operational level.Refractory.How Does Limestone Affect the Environment? ReferenceLimestone mining can pollute water and create sinkholes.When limestone dissolves while it's still in the ground,caves and gullies form,a natural phenomenon known as karst.Although this doesn't hurt the environment in its natural form,once the limestone is mined out,sinkholes can form and disrupt underground waterways.
