## CEMENT RAW MATERIALS International Cement Review
Cement is a manufactured product made by blending different raw materials and firing them at a high temperature in order to achieve precise chemical proportions of lime,silica,alumina and iron in the finished product,known as cement clinker.Cement clinker WikipediaCement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product.Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter.It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.
