## Types of Ore MiningHallOfFame
Ore is rock that contains economic amounts of a particular element,e.g.gold ore,iron ore,molybdenum ore,or praseodimium ore.In contrast,rock that is not judged to contain economic quantities of an element is categorized as waste rock.The metals in ore can occur in many different minerals (compounds) in the rock.As an example,copper occurs in more than 50 mineralsSilver: A native element,mineral,alloy,and byproductSilver as a Native Element Mineral.Silver is rarely found as a native element mineral.When found,it is often associated with quartz,gold,copper,sulfides of other metals,arsenides of other metals,and other silver minerals.Unlike gold,it is rarely found in significant amounts in placer deposits.
