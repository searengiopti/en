## Grade of Concrete Their Ratio,Uses & Suitability.
Grade of Concrete is the classification of concrete according to its compressive strength.For making concrete we use cement,sand,aggregate,and water which are mixed with certain ratio and concrete is cast and put in a cube of 150 mm size and put in a water bath for 28 days and afterward,it is tested in a compression test.What is Water Cement Ratio? Guide & Calculation CivilologyWater Cement Ratio means the ratio between the weight of water to the weight of cement used in concrete mix.Normally water cement ratio falls under 0.4 to 0.6 as per IS Code 10262 (2009) for nominal mix (M10,M15.M25) We all know that water cement ratio will directly affect the strength of concrete.
