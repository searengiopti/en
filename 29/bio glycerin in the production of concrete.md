Glycerol is a major byproduct of the biodiesel industry and can be converted to 1,3 propanediol (1,3 PDO) by microorganisms through a two step enzymatic reaction.The production of 1,3 PDO from glycerol using microorganisms is accompanied by formation of unwanted byproducts,including lactate and 2,3 butanediol,resulting in a low conversion yield.Glycerol: Production,consumption,prices.Glycerol is the simplest of the alcohols and is known by propane 1,2,3 triol according to IUPAC.It is also commercially known as glycerin,1,2,3 propanotriol,trihydroxypropane,glyceritol or glycidic alcohol.
