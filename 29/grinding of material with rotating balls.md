## PG 9BHD Centerless Form Grinder
Starting with a rod of material,the PG 9BHD can produce intricate cylindrical shapes,or even grind the rod directly into balls.The unique oscillating regulating wheel assembly,used in ball form applications,forces parts to rotate randomly while grinding.This ensures sphericity the 3 dimensional roundness of the ball.The Effect of Ball Size Diameter on Milling Performance OMICS.It was determined that the 30 mm diameter balls were most effective of the three sizes during the grinding of the 3 monosize feed material samples.The 10 mm.This inefficiency is a result of various factors such mill load,rotation speed,type of milling (wet or dry) as well as the size of the steel balls [3].Mills are also one of&nbsp;.
