## Iron Ore Pelletizing Bentonite Imerys
Iron Ore Pelletizing Bentonite.The need for iron ore pellets is directly connected to the steel production industry.Through the pelletizing process,iron ore fines are converted into spherical pellets,which are then suitable as feed material in blast furnaces for pig iron production.11.25 Clay Processing US EPA11.25 Clay Processing 11.25.1 Process Description1 4 Clay is defined as a natural,earthy,fine grained material,largely of a group of crystalline hydrous silicate minerals known as clay minerals.Clay minerals are composed mainly of silica,alumina,and water,but they may also contain appreciable quantities of iron,alkalies,and alkaline.
