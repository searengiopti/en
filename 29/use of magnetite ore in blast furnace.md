## Iron ore Wikipedia
Increasing iron ore demand,coupled with the depletion of high grade hematite ores in the United States,after World War II led to development of lower grade iron ore sources,principally the utilization of magnetite and taconite.Iron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined.IRON ORE SINTERING PART 2.QUALITY INDICES AND PRODUCTIVITYIt can be added to the blast furnace as raw flux in the form of dolomite or dunite,or as sinter.The addition of MgO to the raw mix improves the RDI,because MgO stabilises magnetite and thus decreases the hematite content,giving rise to less stress in the sinter during the hematite to magnetite reduction in the blast furnace stack [10].
