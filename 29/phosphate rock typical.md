## Phosphogypsum Stacks
As a result,the market for the phosphogypsum generated by the chemical processing of phosphate rock has traditionally been limited.It has traditionally been piled on land.This was the least expensive way to deal with the by product,which in years gone by accumulated at a much slower rate because phosphate chemical processing plants could.phosphate Alahram GroupPhosphorite,phosphate rock or rock phosphate is a non detrital sedimentary rock which contains high amounts of phosphate bearing minerals.The phosphate content of phosphorite is at least 15 to 20%; if it is assumed that the phosphate minerals in phosphorite are hydroxyapatite and fluoroapatite,phosphate minerals contain roughly 18,5 % phosphorus by weight and if phosphorite contains around.
