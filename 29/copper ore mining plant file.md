## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods.Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels,called adits,to reach the ore.Underground mining is,however,relatively expensive and is generally limited to rich ores.El Teniente,in Chile,is the world's largest.Katanga Mining Provides an Update on Impact of COVID … · The ongoing mining and stockpiling of low grade ore reflects the optimization of the long term plant feed strategy.The low grade ore is stockpiled and expected to be fed into the processing plant.

## The Advantages of Recycling Copper Sciencing
The more copper recycled,the smaller the need for copper mining.Copper mining involves the usage of time,energy and fossil fuels.According to the Copper Development Association,the United States has no need to import copper.This is mostly due to copper recycling,which provides 95 percent of the copper for domestic usage.Copper Refining.Copper Nickel Studies and Non ferrous Mining …The study revealed that copper nickel mining in the region could meet environment standards if available technology was used wisely,but that production near existing iron facilities might exceed established environmental guidelines.The study also found that the ore deposits of the region contained an estimated $50 billion of minerals and that.
