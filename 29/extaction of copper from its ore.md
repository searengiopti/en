## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
The barren rock,or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore.By far the greatest proportion of copper is extracted from the sulfides of copper,iron and sometimes other metals.Such ores originate from sulfur bearing volcanic magmas,which have separated into metal sulfides and siliceous melts.Extraction Of Copper Mining,Concentration,Smelting.Copper Mining: The commonest ore used in the extraction of copper is Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) also known as Copper Pyrites and other such sulfides.The percentage of copper in the actual ore is too low for direct extraction of copper to be viable.

Copper can be extracted from its ore by: 1.Traditional mining.There are many types of copper ore found throughout the world.Picture 4 shows the distribution of these deposits.About 80% of all copper extracted comes from sulphide ores.A typical ore contains only 0.5% to 2.0% copper.It is a measure of the value of copper that it is.How is sulfur extracted from its ores? QuoraThere are no (or very little) sulfur ores,at least today.The main source is the purification process of natural gas and oil : the sulfur is converted into H2S and part of it is burned into SO2 which then react with H2S : SO2 + 2 H2S → 3 S + 2 H2.
