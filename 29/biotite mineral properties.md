## Biotite Wikipedia
Biotite usually occurs in brown to black,dark green variety.It is a name used for a range of black mica minerals with different chemical compositions but with very similar physical properties.These minerals are usually indistinguishable from each other without laboratory analysis.There is a small list of biotite minerals that were down.Biotite A Common Rock Forming MineralBiotite is a member of the mica branch of the silicate mineral group.It is common as a rock forming mineral and is found associated with muscovite,feldspar,and quartz.It has a widespread occurance and is present in all three rock types igneous,metamorphic,and sedimentary.

## Magnetic properties of biotite micas: Journal of Applied.
The magnetic behavior of eight samples of biotite and a lepidomelane was studied in the temperature range 1.5 300 K and analyzed in relation to their chemical composition.The platy morphology of biotite facilitates magnetic measurements with the applied field either in the plane of the sheets (X e ⊥) or perpendicular to the plane (X e ∥).At high temperature,the samples obey Curie.Muscovite Mineral Uses and PropertiesPhysical Properties.Muscovite is easily identified because its perfect cleavage allows it to be split into thin,flexible,elastic,colorless,transparent sheets with a pearly to vitreous luster.It is the only common mineral with these properties.

## Is biotite magnetic Answers
Biotite is a sheet silicate mineral in the mica group.It is formed from the metamorphosis of sedimentary rock under heat and pressure.Asked in Geology,Earth SciencesOptical Properties of MineralsExample of Interference Colors: Biotite,Quartz and Graphite in a Mica Schist Here we see mostly brown biotite flakes.The biotite show various shades of brown and tan in PP light (it is pleochroic).Biotite has moderately high birefringence.In the XP view,the biotite interference colors range up to 2nd order red (with just a hint of 2nd order blue).

## Biotite
Biotite It occurs in more geological environments than any of the other micas.It is a common rock forming mineral,being present in at least some percentage in many igneous rocks (e.g.granite and rhyolite ),and metamorphic rocks (e.g.schist,gneiss ).Biotite Geology Wiki FandomProperties Edit.Like other mica minerals,biotite has a highly perfect basal cleavage,and consists of flexible sheets,or lamellae,which easily flake off.It has a monoclinic crystal system,with tabular to prismatic crystals with an obvious pinacoid termination.It has four prism faces and two pinacoid faces to form a pseudohexagonal crystal.Although not easily seen because of the cleavage.

## Biotite
Biotite is a very common and widespread mineral group.The minerals of the group occur often in metamorphic and igneous rocks.It is much less common in sediments and sedimentary rocks because it yields to clay minerals in the weathering environment.Biotite Water Treatment and Filtration Power OrganicsBiotite deposits are found in many places on the surface of the Earth.When biotite,produced by volcanic eruptions,comes in contact with seawater,it produces acids which structure and purify water.Biotite Liquid Crystal Minerals mimics this natural process to create a liquid that has the same remarkable properties.
