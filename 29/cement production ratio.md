## Cement
Key strategies to cut carbon emissions in cement production include improving energy efficiency,switching to lower carbon fuels,reducing the clinker to cement ratio and advancing process and technology innovations.How Concrete is Made Portland Cement AssociationThe water cement ratio is the weight of the mixing water divided by the weight of the cement.High quality concrete is produced by lowering the water cement ratio as much as possible without sacrificing the workability of fresh concrete,allowing it to be properly placed,consolidated,and cured.

The water cement ratio is the weight of the mixing water divided by the weight of the cement.High quality concrete is produced by lowering the water cement ratio as much as possible without sacrificing the workability of fresh concrete,allowing it to be properly.Cement and Concrete Chemistry SpringerLinkSpecial cements are also discussed.The microstructure of concrete is then presented,and special emphasis is given to the role of the interfacial transition zone,and the corrosion processes in the light of cement phase composition,mineral additions and w c ratio.
