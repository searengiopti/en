## 5 Aggregate Production
As with other compression crushers,the cone crusher yields a somewhat elongated and slivery particle shape.This may be minimized,however,by "choke" feeding the crusher.This technique will also make the shape and size more uniform.One way to choke feed is with a surge hopper and a controlled belt feed to the cone crusher (Figure 5 10).Primary Crusher Selection & DesignHow you select your primary crusher will be based on factors like moisture content,maximum rock lump size,material density SG,abrasion index,degradability and it being prone to dusting or not.The crusher capacities given by manufacturers are typically in tons of 2,000 lbs.and are based on crushing limestone weighing loose about 2,700 lbs.per yard3 and having a specific gravity of 2.6.
