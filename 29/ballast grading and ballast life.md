## Ballast bed resistance characteristics based on discrete
In this study,in situ experiments were conducted to study the changing characteristics of the lateral and longitudinal resistance of a ballast bed,and a threedimensional model for the ballast bed and sleeper was constructed based on the discreteelement method.The effects of the lateral and longitudinal resistance of the ballast bed,such as gravel ballast grading,sleeper depth,the angleBallast FoundationTrabant Solar’s Ballast Foundation is an innovative solution to combat a variety of issues found on most solar project site.Most single axis trackers require a project site to be completely level,which is a time consuming process and results in significant amounts of dust throughout the life of the project.
