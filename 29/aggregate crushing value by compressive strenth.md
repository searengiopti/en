## resistance of concrete to crushing
The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS 2386 Part 4.The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load.To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.Aggregate Crushing Value Civil EngineeringAggregate Crushing value depends on the shape of agg also.Angular aggregates have a lower ACV,than Irregular or rounded aggregates.If we cut a core out of the same agg (Say in the quarry) and test for compressive strength,will give a higher MPa value.It can be considered as a concrete cylinder or UCS tested in lab.So it is hard to corelate
