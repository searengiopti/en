Ball Size vs.Grindability.It has been recognized that the grindability of an ore in a ball mill is a function of both feed and mill parameters: Work index,W i; Largest particle size and size distribution; Density of solids and slurry; Mill diameter; Rotational speed; Rowland and Kjos (1980) defined the largest ball size needed based on these.Mill (grinding) WikipediaF 80 is the mill circuit feed size in micrometers.Rod mill.A rotating drum causes friction and attrition between steel rods and ore particles.[citation needed] But note that the term 'rod mill' is also used as a synonym for a slitting mill,which makes rods of iron or other metal.Rod mills are less common than ball mills for grinding minerals.
