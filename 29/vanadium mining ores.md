## Vanadium processing Britannica
Vanadium processing,preparation of the metal for use in various products.Vanadium (V) is a grayish silver metal whose crystal structure is a body centred cubic (bcc) lattice,with a melting point of 1,926&#176; C (3,499&#176; F).The metal is used principally as an alloying addition to high strengthMicrobial vanadium (V) reduction in groundwater with.The mining areas of vanadium titanomagnetite,stone coal,petroleum associated minerals and uvanite are the main four kinds of vanadium ore mining areas,with vanadium compounds transported into the soil where microbes are domesticated and adapted.
