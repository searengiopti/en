## Primary cementing placement design PetroWiki
A disadvantage to delayed set cementing is the increased water oil contact (WOC) time,which could be expensive if a drilling rig is kept on location while the cement sets and gains strength.If the drilling rig can be moved off location and a workover rig can complete the well.Completion (oil and gas wells)Well completion is the process of making a well ready for production (or injection) after drilling operations.This principally involves preparing the bottom of the hole to the required specifications,running in the production tubing and its associated down hole tools as well as perforating and stimulating as required.Sometimes,the process of running in and cementing the casing is also.
