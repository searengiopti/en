## Roasting (metallurgy) Wikipedia
Roasting is a process of heating of sulphide ore to a high temperature in presence of air.It is a step of the processing of certain ores.More specifically,roasting is a metallurgical process involving gas solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s).Often before roasting,the ore has already been partially purified,e.g.by froth flotation.INNOVATION IN MINERAL PROCESSING Slide Title AND,processing,extractive metallurgy,recycling,and waste minimization • History: The Kroll Institute for Extractive Metallurgy was established at the Colorado School of Mines in 1974 using a bequest from Dr William J Kroll after he died • This effort was led by Professor Al Schlechten For over 45 years,the Kroll
