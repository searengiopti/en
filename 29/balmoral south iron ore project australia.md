South Australia increased its iron ore production from approximately 9.2 Mt in 2010 to just over 10 Mt for 2011,which represented 2% of Australia's total production of iron ore.South Australia's iron ore resource is small when compared with Western Australia,but it is emerging to become the second major iron ore producing State.BHP approves South Flank project BHPFirst ore from South Flank is targeted in the 2021 calendar year,with the project expected to produce ore for more than 25 years.South Flank iron ore will contribute to an increase in WAIO's average iron grade from 61 per cent to 62 per cent,and the overall proportion of lump from 25 per cent to approximately 35 per cent.
