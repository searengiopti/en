## Gold and copper leaching from gold copper ores and.
It is well known that cyanide soluble copper dissolves in cyanide solutions to form toxic copper cyanide complexes such as Cu(CN) 2 −,Cu(CN) 3 2 −,Cu(CN) 4 3 −.A number of studies have been published to treat gold copper ores by either adding ammonia to the conventional cyanidation process,or recycling cyanide after the leaching stage (La Brooy et al.1991,Muir et al.1991,Muir et.Copper extraction WikipediaThe concentrates from different regions have approximately between 24% up to 36% of copper.Copper concentrates are then submitted to a final filtration and drying process to decrease the humidity to 8 9%.Production Process Mainly copper goes through different stages and degrees of refinement,to a lesser extent the byproducts such as molybdenum,sulfuric acid and precious metals that come.
