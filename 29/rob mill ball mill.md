## Rapid determination of Bond rodmill work index by
To calculate Bond rodmill work indices,the four samples were screened and the particle size distributions plotted in Fig.2.The plot was used to find F 80 of the samples for calculations.Fig.3,Fig.4 show the grinding kinetics of Pb,Cu,Fe,and Mn ores in the Bond rodmill in different testsieves.The slopes of all lines in the figures are equal to the k value of Eq.Rod mills,how they functionRod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,

## Grinding mills for mining and minerals processing Metso
Every mining operation has a unique grinding process.Variable needs require versatile grinding equipment.Metso offers flexible autogenous (AG) mills,semi autogenous (SAG) mills,ball and pebble mills,as well as stirred mills to fit your needs.Ball Mills vs Rod MillsThe average particle is subjected to an action similar to many sets of rolls in series,before it is discharged.Because of this,the rod mill can effectively reduce 1″ feed size to 10 mesh or finer in open circuit.The voids (or interstitial space) within a rod load are approximately half those in a ball mill.
