## A Brief Note on the Heap Leaching Technologies for …
Heap leaching is a low cost technology used in industrial mining to recover precious metals such as gold and uranium,along with several other highly sought after metals like copper,from their primary resources (ores and minerals).For many decades,there has been a growing demand for heap leaching due to its environmental benefits.Heap leaching provides mining operators with a benign.Gold CIP,CIL System,Heap Leaching,Cyanidation Process.Gold Mine Heap Leaching Process.Crushed by jaw crushers and cone crushers to a certain particle size (30 50mm),raw ore is directly sent for heaping or granulated (to make finer particles agglomerate into coarse powder),and then transported to the ore heap site for heap.
