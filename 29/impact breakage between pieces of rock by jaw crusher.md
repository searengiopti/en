## Difference Between Jaw Crusher,Cone Crusher and Impact.
Jaw crushers are typically used as primary crushers,or the first step in the process of reducing rock.They typically crush using compression.The rock is dropped between two rigid pieces of metal,one of which then move inwards towards the rock,and the rock is crushed because it has a lower breaking point than the opposing metal piece.jaw.Differences Between Fixed Jaw Crusher and Impact Rock.Differences mainly in structural designs,crushing stages,working principles,performances,sides on environmental protection,final sized products and product shape.Materials like granite,marble,etc.for impact rock crusher.Too high hardness materials like peb

## Jaw Crusher
In Mineral Processing Design and Operations (Second Edition),2016.4.2 Design of Jaw Crushers.Jaw crushers are designed to impart an impact on a rock particle placed between a fixed and a moving plate (jaw).The faces of the plates are made of hardened steel.Both plates could be flat or the fixed plate flat and the moving plate convex.Rock crusherRaw material enters the jaw crusher from the top.Pieces of rock that are larger than the opening at the bottom of the jaw lodge between the two metal plates of the jaw,and the motion of the oscillating jaw against the fixed jaw continues to pound the lodged pieces until they are broken into pieces small enough to drop through the opening at.
