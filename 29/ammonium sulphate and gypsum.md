## Ammonium sulfate sources,health risks
Ammonium sulfate with the molecular formula of (NH 4) 2 SO 4,is an inorganic salt that is commonly used in fertilizers and in the food industry.This chemical compound comes from the heated reaction of ammonia and sulfuric acid.It is a crystal like solid that has no odor,has a little salty taste,and is predominantly useful because of its high solubility properties.Conversion of phosphogypsum to sodium sulfate and.Synthesis of ammonium sulfate The synthesis of ammonium sulfate is made by paddling of carbon dioxide in a solution containing ammonia water to obtain (NH 4) 2 CO 3,which reacts with phosphogypsum [10].This chemical reaction is represented by the following equation: CaSO 4,2H 2 O + (NH 4) 2 CO 3→ (NH 4) 2 SO 4 + CaCO 3 + 2H 2 O (2) 1.4.2.
