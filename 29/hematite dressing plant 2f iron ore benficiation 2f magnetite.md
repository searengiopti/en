## Minerals MDPI
The acid was shown from mineralogical analysis to be efficiently utilized to dissolve the laterite ore,which indicates that the primary iron hydrolysis product was hematite,while the aluminum rich sodium alunite jarosite phase that formed hosts approximately 5% of the hydrolyzed iron.Minerals,Vol.10,Pages 351: The High Temperature Co.Iron Ore AIMR 2011 Australian Mines AtlasIron (Fe) is a metallic element which constitutes about 5% of the Earth's crust and is the fourth most abundant element in the crust.Iron ores are rocks from which metallic iron can be economically extracted.The principal iron ores are hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4).Hematite is an iron oxide mineral.It is non magnetic and has colour variations ranging from steel silver to.
