The mining techniques adopted to extract gemstones invariably reflect the nature of the deposit: primary deposits (in hard rocks,worked underground or in open pits) and secondary deposits (found in sedimentary,soft rock,placers).The mineralogy of a gem dictates the type of geological environment in which it can be found.Appendix F: Underground Coal Mining Methods and.FIGURE F 1 Schematic of a room and pillar coal mine section.SOURCE: Arch Coal,Inc.2012.FIGURE F 2 Details of the longwall face.SOURCE: EIA,1995.There are several variations of each method.However,ever since the introduction of continuous miners in the late 1940s,room and pillar continuous mining has been gaining ground over conventional room and pillar mining.

Declines are often started from the side of the high wall of an open cut mine when the ore body is of a payable grade sufficient to support an underground mining operation but the strip ratio has become too great to support open cast extraction methods.Ore Access.Levels are excavated horizontally off the decline or shaft to access the ore body.Mining Methods21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mining Methods Boxhole Boring.Boxhole boring is similar to the raisebore method,but the drilling machine is located below the mineralization,so development is not required above the mineralization.From a drill chamber in waste rock below the ore,we drill a series of overlapping holes up through the ore zone and collect the falling ore from a chute in the extraction chamber.
