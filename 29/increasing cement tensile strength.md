## Is it possible to enhance the tensile strength of concrete.
the tensile strength cannot be increased by adding steel fibres etc to concrete,only its toughness can be increased.the tensile strength theory is based on the flaw model and the first cracks.Polymer Modification of Cementitious Mortars RonacreteCompressive strength of unmodified concrete and mortars can continue to increase slowly after the initial curing period.However,other physical properties are.

## Relation Between Compressive and Tensile Strength of Concrete
Compressive Strength The main measure of the structural quality of concrete is its compressive strength.This property of concrete is commonly considered in structural design.Depending on the mix (especially the water cement ratio) and time and quality of the curing,compressive strength of concrete can be obtained up to 14,000 psi or more.Commercial production of concrete with ordinary.Ceramics for Strength sanjosedeltaCeramics tend to be weak in tension,but strong in compression For a metal,the compressive strength is near that of the tensile strength,while for a ceramic,the compressive strength may be 10 times the tensile strength Alumina,for example,has a tensile strength of 20,000 psi 1138 MPa),while the compressive strength is 350,000 psi (2400 MPa)

The tensile strength of concrete is relatively low and takes time and maturity to develop; at early ages the tensile strength is negligible.Attempts to increase concrete's tensile strength by increasing the cement content or by adding supplementary cementitious materials,such as silica fume,fail to improve the situation (or may even.The Importance of Water Cement Ratio « Concrete Countertop InstituteThe water to cement ratio,or w c ratio,largely determines the strength and.A lower w c ratio of 0.4 is generally specified if a higher quality concrete is desired.the tensile and flexural strengths,the porosity,the shrinkage and the color.
