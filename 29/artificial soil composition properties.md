## The Effects of Chemical Fertilizers on Soil Hunker
Chemical fertilizers or inorganic fertilizers are manmade soil enhancers used to raise the level of nutrients found in soil.The natural nutrients found in the soil essential to plant growth,such as nitrogen,phosphorus and potassium,are manufactured synthetically from inorganic material and applied to soil in the form of chemical fertilizers.Development of Uniform Artificial Soil Deposition,The dust particles vary from one location to the other in terms of particle size,color and chemical composition These properties influence the extent of performance (current) loss,spectral loss and adhesion of soil particles on the surface of the PV modul
