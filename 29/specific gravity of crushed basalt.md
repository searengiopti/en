## Density & Specific Gravity Some Meteorite Information.
Just as useful as density,however,is the specific gravity.Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass (weight) of a rock to the mass of the same volume of water.Water has a density of 1.0 g cm 3,so the numeric value of specific gravity for a rock is the same as that for density.Because specific gravity is a ratio,it has no unit.basalt fibre SlideShareFeb 23,2015 · Basalt rocks with SiO2 content about 46% (acid basalt) are suitable for fiber production.7.BASALT QUARRY [ESSINGEN EIFEL] 8.MANUFACTURING PROCESS OF BASALT FIBRE Quarried basalt rock is first crushed,then washed and moved into melting baths in gas heated furnaces.under temperature of 1460 1500 °C.

## Graphite: A mineral with extreme properties and many uses
When graphite is in high enough concentrations,these rocks can be mined,crushed to a particle size that liberates the graphite flakes,and processed by specific gravity separation or froth flotation to remove the low density graphite.The product produced is known as "flake graphite." Graphite From Coal Seam Metamorphism ("Amorphous" Graphite)The Density Of Crushed BasaltThe study indicated further that the crushed basalt under triaxial compression has a lower shear strength than when sheared under plane strain conditions.Particles crushed were significantly influenced by the stress level and gradation and to a lesser degree by density of material.Mass,Weight,Density or Specific Gravity of Bulk.
