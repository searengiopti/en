## How copper is made material,used,processing,steps.
Process The process of extracting copper from copper ore varies according to the type of ore and the desired purity of the final product.Each process consists of several steps in which unwanted materials are physically or chemically removed,and the concentration of copper is progressively increased.Brazing copper and copper alloys The FABRICATORBrazing copper and copper alloys ; Brazing copper and copper alloys.Brazing is more often used for small parts and requires heating a broad surface to bring the filler material to its flow point,which is often impractical with large pieces.TPA schedule mill process presentations for pipe,tube,roll forming conference.

## From Ore to Finished Product Copper
From its original home buried underground in a mine to its use in a finished product such as wire or pipe,copper passes through a number of stages.process flow is smelting for sulfide ore concentrate and solvent extraction for oxide ore leach solution.6.Refining.Copper from the smelter is melted and cast as anodes,the solution from.Copper tubing WikipediaTypes Soft copper.Soft (or ductile) copper tubing can be bent easily to travel around obstacles in the path of the tubing.While the work hardening of the drawing process used to size the tubing makes the copper hard or rigid,it is carefully annealed to make it soft again; it is,therefore,more expensive to produce than non annealed,rigid copper tubing.
