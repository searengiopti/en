## About Aluminium Tomago
It is found in the form of aluminium oxide in an ore called bauxite.Aluminium is obtained by the electrolysis of alumina which extracts pure aluminium metal.Bauxite WikipediaAustralia is the largest producer of bauxite,followed by China.In 2017,China was the top producer of aluminium with almost half of the world's production,followed by Russia,Canada,and India.Although aluminium demand is rapidly increasing,known reserves of its bauxite ore are sufficient to meet the worldwide demands for aluminium for many centuries.
