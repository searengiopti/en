## Mine Tailings Ground Truth Trekking
Mine tailings are the ore waste of mines,and are typically a mud like material.Worldwide,the storage and handling of tailings is a major environmental issue.Many tailings are toxic and must be kept perpetualy isolated from the environment.Scale of tailings production is immense,since metal extraction is usually only ounces or pounds,for.Mining Waste Management: Reprocessing TailingsThanks to the progress in technology,the reduction of ore grades,and a more environmentally friendly vision,companies are starting to care more about mining waste management by reprocessing tailings to increase their value.Let’s take a look at some reprocessing projects around the world:

Apart from the considerable storage of tailing waste,it also causes tremendous environment issues such as acid mine drainage and air contamination.Case Study: Geochemistry and Mineralogy of Copper …The tailings material consists of alternating layers of sand,silt and clay.According to geochemical pattern,the tailings dump can be subdivided into three groups,as shown in Fig.1.Heap I and II are enriched in Fe and Co (Fig.2).Special feature of heap I is a depletion in S and Ca but a high percentage of loss on ignition (LOI).
