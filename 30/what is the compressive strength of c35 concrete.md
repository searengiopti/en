How do you create mix concrete strength C35?.Concrete with compressive strength more than 55 MPa is known as high strength concrete.High Strength ConcreteHigh strength concrete is specified where reduced weight is important or where architectural considerations call for small support elements.By carrying loads more efficiently than normal strength concrete,high strength concrete also reduces the total amount of material placed and lowers the overall cost of the structure.
