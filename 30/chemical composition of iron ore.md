But what is iron,where does it come from and how do we get it?.It is present in nearly every rock of the crust and mantle as a chemical component of hundreds of different minerals.Definition,Formula & Examples What is Nickel?What Is the Composition of Cast Iron? ReferenceCast iron breaks when it is loaded with significant pressure,although the carbon content in cast iron makes this metal good for casting.This type of cast iron is called grey cast iron,and its main characteristic is the greycolored carbon flakes in its composition.To produce cast iron,iron ore is deoxidized in a blast furnace.

## Pyrite: The mineral pyrite information and pictures
Pyrite was once used as a source of sulfur,but is now only a minor ore for both sulfur and iron.Pyrite from some localities is auriferous,and therefore is used as an ore of gold in goldbearing localities.Pyrite was polished by the Native Americans in the early times and used as mirrors.Today,it is used as an ornamental stone,as well as a very popular stone for amateur collectors.Corrosion PropertiesIron is a moderately active metal and corrodes readily in the presence of water.The natural state of iron is iron oxide and the most common iron ore is Hematite with a chemical composition of Fe 2 0 3.Rust,the most common corrosion product of iron,also has a chemical composition of Fe 2 O 3.
