## Can a 60Hz motor run on 50Hz power supply?
The data can be found on motor nameplate.Why the difference is 20%? The main cause to motor heat (temperature rise) is a load current.From motor output power formula P=SQRT(3)*U*I*cosF*ETA it is clear that the current will remain about the same when we will use 400V 50Hz motor power and 460V 60Hz 50Hz+20% motor power.How to Size the Electric Motor Circuit Breaker HunkerThe interesting part about motors is that the amount of start up current and the current the motor uses after it is running is not the same.Depending on the size of the motor,the start up current can be up to six times greater than the running current.Another issue is that motors require two types of protection,overload and short circuit.
