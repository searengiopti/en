## Anthracite Coal Characteristics and Applications
Anthracite coal,mined from the planet's oldest geological formations,has spent the longest time underground.The coal has been subjected to the most pressure and heat,making it the most compressed and hardest coal available.Hard coal contains greater potential to produce heat energy than softer,geologically &quot;newer&quot; coal.Energy size reduction of mixtures of anthracite and …Soft coking coal promote the energy size reduction of hard anthracite coal in mixture breakage,with the increase of breakage indicator (A and b) and energy efficiency compared with those of single breakage.Energy split factors of anthracite coal is above one,and increases with the product fineness.And coking coal shows the contrary trend.
