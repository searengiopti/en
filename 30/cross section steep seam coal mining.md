## Considerations for Underground Coal Mines That Operate.
Mines in the late 1960' s were based on horizontal dril holes in the coal seam that were driled from a shaft sunk into a coal seam (Fields,H.H.et.aI,1973).Several underground coal mines currently use horizontal in seam techniques to extract CBM from locations inside the mine.A cross panel horizontal hole system is shown in Figure 5.Dragline Mining & Reclamation MiningThe unique application of a large walking dragline in the mountains of southern West Virginia was developed and implemented by Hobet Mining,Inc.Hobet is an independent operating subsidiary of Ashland Coal and is headquartered at the No.21 Mine in Boone County,West Virginia,near Danville.Hobet also operates the 07 Mine located in Logan County,West Virginia,near Holden.
