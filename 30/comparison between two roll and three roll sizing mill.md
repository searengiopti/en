## Hot Rolled Steel vs.Cold Rolled Steel,What’s. SPACO
Theoretically,the only difference between hot rolled and cold rolled steels is that hot rolled steel is rolled to its final dimensions while hot enough to scale (over about 1700 degrees F) while cold rolled steel is rolled to its final dimensions well below scaling temperatures.ALUMINUM PRODUCTS Alro Steel10 3 alro NOTE: Typical properties shown for alloys are not guaranteed by publication herein In most cases,the values are averages for various sizes,product
