The next step in processing is called beneficiation.This is the first step in concentrating the copper into a more useable form.5.Smelting and Extraction.The next step in the process flow is smelting for sulfide ore concentrate and solvent extraction for oxide ore leach solution.Copper from the smelter is melted and cast as anodes,the.Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores,Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 9999% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday useThe most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,

## Copper Refining an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Solvent extraction has been routinely used for copper refining since its invention in the 1960s,and it is suggested that well over 10% of refined copper production from ores is obtained by solvent extraction,accounting for millions of tonnes of metal.It is even more popular for refining copper from scrap.copper extraction and refining humanachildaid.orgCopper mining.From ore to copper.SchoolScience.co.uk Mining: Copper can be extracted from its ore by: 1.Traditional mining.The copper is recovered by.
