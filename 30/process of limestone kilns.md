## Lime kiln Wikipedia
A lime kiln is a kiln used for the calcination of limestone (calcium carbonate) to produce the form of lime called quicklime (calcium oxide).Cement kiln WikipediaA typical process of manufacture consists of three stages: grinding a mixture of limestone and clay or shale to make a fine "rawmix" (see Rawmill);; heating the rawmix to sintering temperature (up to 1450 °C) in a cement kiln;
