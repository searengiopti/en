## Geochemical solid characterization of drill cuttings,…
Sr levels in drill cuttings are elevated (see Fig.6) compared to concentrations in the shale core,likely due to drilling mud barite serving as a source of Sr.Both Ba and Sr in drill cuttings can be partially extracted form acid soluble fractions,likely from components within drilling mud residuals (see Fig.8).4)Weighting Agents SchlumbergerM I SWACO provides barite and hematite materials to impart density to all water based and invert emulsion drilling fluids.Weighting agents are used to control formation pressures,prevent formation caving,and facilitate the pulling of dry pipe.
