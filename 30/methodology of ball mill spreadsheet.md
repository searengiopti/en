## Ball Milling method for synthesis of nanomaterials.
Steps in ball milling method; 1.As the name suggests,the ball milling method consists of balls and a mill chamber.Therefore over all a ball mill contains a stainless steel container and many small iron,hardened steel,silicon carbide,or tungsten carbide balls are made to rotate inside a mill (drum).Addition of pebbles to a ball mill to improve grinding efficiency.Each pebble feed size produces a steady state distribution,analogous to the ball mill calculation.A spreadsheet was used to accumulate weighted data for all feed pebble sizes.This method makes the simplifying assumption that the pebble wear rate is independent of pebble size.This assumption was examined later.
