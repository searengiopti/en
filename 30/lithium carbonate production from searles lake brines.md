A problem with their production has been that the potash content is always weak (usually only about 1 2% KCl),and thus a solar evaporation,or expensive plant evaporation step,was first required.Also,the brines always contain many other ions,thus compliing the separation of potash from the evaporated brine or crystallized salts.Minerals OPEN ACCESS mineralsthe lithium is precipitated in the form of lithium chloride or lithium carbonate [2].In 1936,lithium production from brines ﬁrst commenced from the Searles Lake in the USA [2].Since then brines with high lithium concentrations have been exploited principally in South America and China.Oilﬁeld brines
