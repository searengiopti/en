## Iron ore pelletizing systems Metso
Iron ore fines are agglomerated into pellets and then indurated using a furnace to create iron ore pellets.These are typically fed to a blast furnace or DRI plant as part of the process to make steel.fluxing agents like limestone or dolomite,and if the ore is a Hematite with coke or anthracite coal as an internal fuel.The mixing is done.Formation of NO and SO2 in the Sintering Process of Iron,Oct 27,2021&#0183;&#32;In the actual sintering process,a variety of raw materials,such as limestone and iron ore,are mixed with coal in the sinter mix Therefore,the formation of NO and SO 2 might be affected by the catalytic effect of the mixed raw materials Tomas da Rocha et al confirmed the effect of CaO and FeO on the formation of NO in coal combustion In.
