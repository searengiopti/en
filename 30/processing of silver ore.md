## Silver ores Danafloat
The most common silver bearing minerals recovered by flotation are argentiferous galena,native silver,argentite (Ag2S) and tetrahedrite (Cu,Fe,Ag) Sb4S3).Often these minerals float with the base metals such as copper and lead sulphides or are the primary target mineral (tetrahedrite).Ore processing Waihi GoldOre processing is a 24 hour operation.Ore is stockpiled (1) at the processing plant,and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader.The ore is conveyed,and lime is added (2) to raise the pH of the ore.
