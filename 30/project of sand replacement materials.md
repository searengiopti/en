## Recent Trends in Replacement of Natural Sand With
alternative material to natural sand.Some alternatives materials have already been used as a replacement of natural sand such as flyash,quarry dust or limestone and siliceous stone powder,filtered sand,copper slag are used in concrete and mortar mixtures as a partial or full replacement of natural sand (Chandana Sukesh et al 2013)[9].Performance of structural concrete with recycled plasticThe dumping of such materials which degrade at extremely low rates meaning they persist in the environment is a longterm environmental concern.To tackle both issues,it is proposed to process waste plastic to create a partial replacement for fine sand in a novel mix for structural concrete.
