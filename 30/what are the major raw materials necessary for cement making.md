## Cement manufacturing
Cement is typically made from limestone and clay or shale.These raw materials are extracted from the quarry crushed to a very fine powder and then blended in the correct proportions.This blended raw material is called the 'raw feed' or 'kiln feed' and is heated in a rotary kiln where it reaches a temperature of about 1400 C to 1500 C.what are the major raw materials necessary for cement makingThe major raw materials for cement manufacture are limestone and laterite,which are natural minerals obtained within the state.These raw materials provide all necessary ingredients of cement like lime,silica,alumina and iron oxide.

## Soap and detergent Raw materials Britannica
Soap and detergent Soap and detergent Raw materials: Fatty alcohols are important raw materials for anionic synthetic detergents.Development of commercially feasible methods in the 1930s for obtaining these provided a great impetus to synthetic detergent production.The first fatty alcohols used in production of synthetic detergents were derived from body oil of the sperm or bottlenose.Composition of cement2000 3 17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This is a fluxing agent which reduces the melting temperature of the raw materials in the kiln (from 3,000 o F to 2,600 o F).It hydrates rapidly,but does not contribute much to strength of the cement paste.By mixing these compounds appropriately,manufacturers can produce different types of cement to suit several construction environments.
