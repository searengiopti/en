## The Mercury Gold Relationship: mercury use in small scale,
Mercury has been used for the past fifty years in artisanal small scale mining methods in roughly eighty countries,and its use is increasing Between 1996 and 2002,a modern gold rush was triggered by a 10 fold increase in the price of gold,and other factors such as increasing poverty are driving more people toward gold mining,using whatever.5 Where do the world's supplies of mercury come from?Private stocks (such as mercury in use in chlor alkali and other industries),some of which may later be returned to the market The mining and other mineral extraction of primary mercury constitute the human mobilisation of mercury for intentional use in products and process
