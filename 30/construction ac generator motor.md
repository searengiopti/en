Generator and Motor.A hand cranked generator can be used to generate voltage to turn a motor.This is an example of energy conversion from mechanical to electrical energy and then back to mechanical energy.As the motor is turning,it also acts as a generator and generates a "back emf".Difference between DC Motor and DC Generator ‚Ä¶DC motor and DC generator are similar from the mechanical perspective,however from a technical stand point,both differ from each other significantly.The most significant difference between DC motor and DC generator lies in the conversion mechanism.DC motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy whereas DC generator converts mechanical energy into an electrical energy.
