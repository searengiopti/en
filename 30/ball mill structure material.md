## Effect of mill type on the size reduction and phase.
Sep 29,2015 · Effect of mill type on the size reduction and phase transformation of gamma alumina.Shear induced phase transformation is observed in planetary ball mill.This shows that dry planetary ball milling results in a change in the crystal structure of the material and induces a phase transformation from the γ to the α alumina phase.structure and chemical reactivity of ball milled. Science Directwas chosen as starting material.Different milling tool materials (agate,stainless steel,WC) were used to vary the energy transfer to the milled graphite powder.The milling process was performed in a conventional planetary ball mill Retsch 4000 with three different milling tool materials: agate.(ag),stainless steel (St).
