## Rutile as a potential indior mineral for metamorphosed metallic
Projet DIVEX SC2 WilliamsJones: Rutile as an indior mineral for metamorphosed metal deposits.1.SUMMARY.Rutile occurs commonly in mineralized zones and alteration haloes of many hydrothermal and metamorphosed ore deposits,and typically has a composition that deviates significantly from pure TiO2.Difference Between Metallic Minerals and Non Metallic.Generally,metallic minerals are originated from the igneous types of rocks,whereas,generally,non metallic minerals are originated from the sedimentary rocks.Metallic minerals are hard have a shiny appearance of their own,while non metallic minerals are not as hard as the metallic minerals and have no shine or luster of their own.
