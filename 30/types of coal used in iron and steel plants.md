## Coal prices and outlook U.S.Energy Information.
Oct 31,2019 · A more expensive coal is used to make iron and steel.In addition to producing electricity,coal is also used to produce coal coke,or coke,which is used in smelting iron ore to make steel.Coke is made by baking certain types of coal in special high temperature ovens to remove non carbon elements and compounds as gases.What are the types of coal?2020 2 24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;There are four major types (or “ranks”) of coal.Rank refers to steps in a slow,natural process called “coalification,” during which buried plant matter changes into an ever denser,drier,more carbon rich,and harder material.The four ranks are:
