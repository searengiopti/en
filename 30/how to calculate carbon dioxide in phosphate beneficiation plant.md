Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy,normally from the sun,into chemical energy that can be later released to fuel the organisms' activities.This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules,such as sugars,which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water hence the name photosynthesis.Inferring pH from Conductivity and Cation Conductivity.Carbon dioxide affects the pH,conductivity and cation conductivity.When carbon dioxide dissolves in condensate,it neutralizes a portion of the ammonia,forming ammonium carbonate.
