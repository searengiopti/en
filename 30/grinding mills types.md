## Fine grinding: How mill type affects particle shape.
The breakage mechanisms in stirred mills regardless of the mill orientation are typically described as abrasion and attrition (Gao and Forssberg,1995,Sinnott et al.2006,Wills and Napier Munn,2006,Ye et al.2010),or more simply “shear” breakage (Radziszewski,2013).The dominant breakage mechanism in ball mills is generally considered to be impact breakage in the toe of the.Size reduction Solids and powder milling PowderProcess.netThe mill is filled with the grinding beads as well as the product,then the mill is rotated until a speed sufficiently high so that the beads can tumble freely.It should be noted that,in some applications,a stirrer is present to agitate the beads,and the drum is therefore not rotating.
