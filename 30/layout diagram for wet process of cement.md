## The Design of Reinforced Concrete Slabs
Concrete,reinforcement,and formwork are the three primary expenses in cast in place concrete floor construction to consider throughout the design process,but especially during the initial planning stages.Of these three,formwork comprises about 55 percent of the total cost and has the greatest influence on the overall cost of the floor system.Cement Extraction and processing BritannicaCement Cement Extraction and processing: Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones,slates,and some shales,with the aid of blasting when necessary.Some deposits are mined by underground methods.Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators.
