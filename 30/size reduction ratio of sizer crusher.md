## AMIT 135: Lesson 5 Crushing Mining Mill Operator Training
Calculation of reduction ratio in crushing [image: (135 5 3)] Crushing Equipment The selection of the right crushing equipment is influenced by many factors some of which are upstream of the crushing plant (e.g.blasting pattern and mining method) and others which are downstream of the crushing plant (e.g.mill and grinding circuit selection).Tips to maximize crushing efficiency Pit & Quarry : Pit. · Efficiency can be defined by the ratio of a machine’s work to the energy supplied to the machine.To apply what this means to your crusher,operations produce the exact sizes in the reduction process that their market demands.In the past,quarries produced a range of single size aggregate products up to 40 mm in size.
