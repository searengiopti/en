## Blast Furnace Slag National Slag Association
Blast Furnace Slag is formed when iron ore or iron pellets,coke and a flux (either limestone or dolomite) are melted together in a blast furnace.When the metallurgical smelting process is complete,the lime in the flux has been chemically combined with the aluminates and silicates of the ore and coke ash to form a non metallic product called blast furnace slag.Electric Arc Furnaces vs Blast FurnacesAug 22,2017&#0183;&#32;However,these furnaces work slightly differently than they did 2000 years ago Today,coke is used to melt the iron ore to create pig iron Oxygen is then used to further transform the pig iron into steel This process requires a continual supply of coke as well as very large furnaces that produce high CO2 emissions Electric Arc Furnaces
