## Ilmenite Wikipedia
The Tellnes mine is one of the largest titanium mines in Europe.The mine is located about 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) northeast of the Jøssingfjorden in Sokndal municipality in Rogaland county,Norway.The mine has reserves amounting more than 300,000,000 tonnes (300,000,000 long tons; 330,000,000 short tons) of ore grading 18% titanium.Ilmenite Direct Reduction Project In Norway Using The.In this process,balled ilmenite concentrate is fed to a traveling grate where pellets are dried and preheated,using fully oxidized kiln exhaust gas.Hot preheated,semi indurated pellets are fed directly to a ported kiln where reduction of the ilmenite's iron oxide fraction occurs in the presence of lump coal.

Heavy mineral sands are a class of ore deposit which is an important source of zirconium,titanium,thorium,tungsten,rare earth elements,the industrial minerals diamond,sapphire,garnet,and occasionally precious metals or gemstones.Heavy mineral sands are placer deposits formed most usually in beach environments by concentration due to the specific gravity of the mineral grains.Tellnes Mines,Sokndal,Rogaland,NorwayTellnes Mines,Sokndal,Rogaland,Norway : The Tellnes deposit was discovered in 1954 by an aeromagnetic survey.Production started at Tellnes in October 1960,while the Storgangen operation continued until 1965.Since then all of Titania's.
