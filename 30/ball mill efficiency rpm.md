## how speed of ball mill affect the grinding efficiency
The major factors discussed were: (1) As mill diameters increase critical speed specified in rpm decreases.(Bond,1960).This is an inverse relationship of the square root of the mill Increases in grinding efficiency with increasing ball mill diameters makesTECHNICAL AND COMMERCIAL BENEFITS OF GEARLESS …general,the bigger the mill diameter,the lower are the mill operating and critical speeds.Thus,for larger mills the number of poles will increase.As a result,the number of poles can vary from 48 to 72 poles (Fig.3.) with typical mill speed requirements of about 10 rpm for larger SAG mills and about 15 rpm for smaller ball mills.Figure 3.

## What type of motor for a ball mill?
What type of motor for a ball mill? posted in Tools and Tooling: Hello,I am looking to get into pyrotechnics and I was just wondering what type of motor I should get for my ball mill? What rpm for direct drive? Also,would I be able to wire the motor directly to my mains (230v AC)? I prefer to make things myself when possible,its more fun that way so I was going to make a ball mill to make.Ball Mill Grinding Efficiency TheoryBall Mill.Ball mill is the key equipment for grinding after the crushing process,which is widely used in the manufacture industries,such as cement,silicate,new building material,refractory material,fertilizer,ferrous metal,nonferrous metal and glass ceramics and can be used for the dry and wet grinding for all kinds of ores and other grind able materials.

Oct 19,2006 · What it is the optimun speed for a ball mill ? posted in Pyrotechnics: I have done a ball mill,recenly finished,but the motor has too rpms,is too fast for use in a ball mill (the pvc cylinder that i use,left of the shafts).With the motor i will use a 40 mm pulley,because i have a 50 mm driven pulley,in one of my two shafts.In the other side of my shafts there are two 40 mm.The energy efficiency of ball milling in comminution.In terms of the Brace and Walsh surface free energy of quartz,his results give a ball mill efficiency that is less than 0.5%.Schoenert (1986) proposed several different definitions for the energy efficiency of ball mills,depending on the type of reference chosen.The first is what he termed the theoretical efficiency,which is based on.
