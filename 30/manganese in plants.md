## On the Role of Manganese in Photosynthesis
Abstract.Euglena gracilis (Klebs) cultures were grown under conditions where limitation in supply of manganese limited chlorophyll content much more than growth.Although the initial rates of photosynthetic oxygen evolution were not affected by the level of manganese,photoinhibition in high intensity light was markedly influenced.manganese Uses,Facts,& Compounds BritannicaManganese is essential to plant growth and is involved in the assimilation of nitrates in green plants and algae.It is an essential trace element in higher animals,in which it participates in the action of many enzymes.Lack of manganese causes testicular atrophy.An excess of this element in plants.
