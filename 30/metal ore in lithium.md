## Lithium Geoscience Australia
Dec 31,2017 · Lithium is also used in fluxes and glazes as it has the highest specific heat of any solid element.Being the lightest known metal,lithium is also used in alloys to increase strength to weight ratios,taking advantage of lithium's tensile strength and light weight (low density) characteristics.Lithium ScienceViews.comLithium is a metallic element that is widely distributed in the earth's crust at low concentrations.Lepidolite,petalite,and spodumene,are important mineral sources of lithium.Subsurface brines,which is water that is saltier than seawater) are the dominant raw material for lithium carbonate production worldwide because of lower production costs as compared with the costs for hard rock ores.
