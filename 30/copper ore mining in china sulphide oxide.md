## How Hydrometallurgy and the SX EW Process Made Copper.
To be applicable to this process,the ores must contain copper minerals in sulfide form; as mineral such as Chalcocite (Cu 2 S),Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and Covellite (CuS).In the concentrating operations these minerals are separated from the gangue material of the ore,that might contain as little as 0.5% copper to form a concentrate.Innovations: How Hydrometallurgy and the SX EW.
