## Development of a Laboratory Scale Leaching Plant for Metal.
Semicontinuous biohydrometallurgical processing of fly ash from municipal waste incineration was performed in a laboratory scale leaching plant (LSLP) by using a mixed culture of Thiobacillus thiooxidans and Thiobacillus ferrooxidans.The LSLP consisted of three serially connected reaction vessels,reservoirs for a fly ash suspension and a bacterial stock culture,and a vacuum filter unit.(PDF) Leaching of elements from cement activated fly ash.Very few studies have investigated the leaching characteristics of cement activated fly ash and slag treated soils,although the inclusion of cement significantly enhances the material pH and may alter the leachability of elements.In this study the
