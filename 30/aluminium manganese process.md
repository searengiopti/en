## Aluminium Wikipedia,the free encyclopedia
Aluminium was selected as the material to be used for the apex of the Washington Monument in 1884,a time when one ounce (30 grams) cost the daily wage of a common worker on the project; aluminium was about the same value as silver.The American Charles Martin Hall of Oberlin,Ohio applied for a patent (U.S.Patent 400,664 ) in 1886 for an electrolytic process to extract aluminium using the.Aluminium alloy WikipediaAluminium alloys (or aluminum alloys; see spelling differences) are alloys in which aluminium (Al) is the predominant metal.The typical alloying elements are copper,magnesium,manganese,silicon,tin and zinc.There are two principal classifications,namely casting alloys and wrought alloys,both of which are further subdivided into the categories heat treatable and non heat treatable.
