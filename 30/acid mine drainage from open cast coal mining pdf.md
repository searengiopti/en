Summary.Acid mine drainage (AMD) refers to the outflow of acidic water from a mining site.In most cases,this acid comes primarily from oxidation of iron sulfide (FeS2,also known as pyrite or "fool's gold"),which is often found in conjunction with valuable metals.Acid mine drainage is a major problem with many hardrock mines,including almost all mines where the metal ore is bound up with.Acid Mine Drainage Mining Technology InfoMineThis mining review surveys online resources relevant to acid mine drainage.plays a major role in creating Acid mine drainage problems in coal,metal (gold) mines.Channel (OLC),Modified Open Limestone Channel (MOLC),Leach Bed and Oxic Limestone drain.http: water.epa.gov polwaste nps upload amd.pdf&nbsp;.

## Open pit mining Wikipedia
Open pit,open cast or open cut mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow.This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth,such as long wall mining.Open pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface.What Are the Environmental Impacts From Mining &amp DrillingJul 25,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Environmental impacts from fossil fuel pollution are rapidly increasing in regions that have the highest concentrations of fuels.There are multiple effects of mining fossil fuels.Drilling and mining practices take a substantial toll on local water sources,biologic life and natural resources.
