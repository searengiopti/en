## CALCULATION OF MAXIMUM BALL SIZE FOR BALL MILL GRINDING
 · Mill effective diameter = 2.23 m.335 is a constant used for dry grinding with steel balls in the mill.Actual size of media is taken is lower than the calculated value.It is around 80 to 90 mm.If you Wants to reduce the maximum ball size,thenreduce the feed size by using pre grinding operation.Design considerations for large diameter ball mills.Large mill (D&gt;5.0 m (16.5 ft)) performance has been successfully predicted from small scale batch experiment for grinding kinetics and an RTD correlation for transport using population balance models.The effect of ball size must be properly taken into account in the scale up.A design method that combined the kinetic scale up

## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotatisagdesign.comTransfer Size,T80,microns Ore SG Ball Mill Grindability,kWh ton Average No ENERGY REQUIREMENTS CALCULATION: Pebble Crusher,Y N From SAGDesign testwork results.Notes Ball Mill Reduction Ratio,RR Inefficiency for coarser feed to ball mill Inefficiency for finer final product size Efficiency for BM diameter other than 8 ft MILL PINION ENERGY.
