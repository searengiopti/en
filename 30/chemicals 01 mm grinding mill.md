## M Series Fine Ginder Commercial Dry Grinder
Prater Fine Grinders (M Series Mills) are designed to grind dry,free flowing material as fine as 200 mesh (75 microns) with a very tight distribution of particle size.The highly efficient design allows for ease of access to all internals and is well suited for heat sensitive materials such as resins and sugar.Vertical mill simulation applied to iron ores ScienceDirectThe vertical mill was invented in Japan in the 1950s by the Tower Mill Kubota Corporation for applications in fine and ultrafine grinding and was the first vertical mill used in the mining industry.Fig.1 shows a vertical mill,also called tower mill.Download : Download full size image Fig.1.Tower mill.
