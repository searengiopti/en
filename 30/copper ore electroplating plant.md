## Copper mining and processing from mine to copper plate
The above flowsheet shows a basic copper mine process,from mine to metal.There are two distinct types of copper ore,the sulfide ore and the oxide ore.The sulfide ores are beneficiated in flotation cells,while the oxide ores are generally leached.Power consumed in electroplating copper ranges from 0.08 to 0.20 KWH per pound of copper.Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores,Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 9999% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday useThe most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.

## Electrowinning Wikipedia
Electrowinning,also called electroextraction,is the electrodeposition of metals from their ores that have been put in solution via a process commonly referred to as leaching.Electrorefining uses a similar process to remove impurities from a metal.Both processes use electroplating on a large scale and are important techniques for the economical and straightforward purification of non.Improving efficiency of electroplating wastewater treatmentApr 27,2018 · The experiment demonstrated the ability of high degree purification of wastewater from electroplating production,removing hexavalent chrome,iron,copper,nickel,zinc and cadmium with simultaneous reduction of treatment duration by electromagnetic vortex.
