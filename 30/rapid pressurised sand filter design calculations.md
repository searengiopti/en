## 17 Rapid filtration Luiz di Bernardo
12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Rapid filtration 17.1 Introduction As explained in the previous chapter,filtration is the process whereby water is purified by passing it through a porous material (or medium).In rapid filtration sand is commonly used as the filter medium1 but the process is quite different from slow sand filtration.Filtration MRWAfiltration.Most rapid sand filters contain 24 30 inches of sand,but some newer filters are deeper.The sand used is generally 0.4 to 0.6 mm in diameter.This is larger than the sand used in slow rate filtration.The coarser sand in the rapid filters has larger voids that do not fill as easily.
