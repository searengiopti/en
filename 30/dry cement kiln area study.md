A cement is a binder,a substance used for construction that sets,hardens,and adheres to other materials to bind them together.Cement is seldom used on its own,but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry,or with sand and gravel,produces concrete.Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is only behind water.Principles and Practices of Drying Lumber Wood,Concretesystem other than moisture added by the drying lumber.This method of drying is most popular for oak and other hard to dry species.Low Temperature Dehumidification Drying Dehumidification drying is a form of kiln drying.With a dehumidifier,moisture is removed from the dryer by condensing the moisture on cold coils.When the water condenses.
