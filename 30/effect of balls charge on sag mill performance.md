## Increasing the load density of grinding balls in the mill.
The picture shows the balls distribution in the mill under normal load.With such laying out of the balls of the same diameter,the volume is distributed as follows: 52% goes to grinding balls,48% is a void volume.That means,to achieve maximum grinding fineness,it is necessary to charge balls …Mill (grinding) WikipediaSAG is an acronym for Semi Autogenous Grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills but use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor.
