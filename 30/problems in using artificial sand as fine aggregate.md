## Strength and Durability Properties of Granite Powder Concrete
The most commonly used fine aggregate across world is river sand.River sand is expensive due to excessive cost of transportation from natural sources.Also large scale depletion of the source creates environmental problems.As environmental,transportation and other constraints make the availability and use of river sand less attractive.A substitute or replacement product for concrete.Crushed Sand vs.Natural Sand: Make the Right Choice!The construction industry has a huge need to solve this challenge.This is also resulting in poor qualities of sand,particularly containing silt.They need to solve this challenge by using crushed sand in construction works.It is a better substitute for natural sand considering increasing demand of sand in construction industry.

## :: ARTIFICIAL SAND
From the above design results it can be observed that the strength of Concrete increases with Artificial Sand.More over the presence of Fines in artificial sand increases the workability and gives more sound Concrete.The slabs,using Artificial sand,are more leak proof than by river sand.An Experimental Investigation on Self Compacting Concrete.One of the solution for this problems is the use of alternative materials for river sand such as artificial fine aggregate,industrial by products (some forms of slag,bottom ash),recycled.
