## Mineral deposit
Mineral deposits that are magmatic cumulates are only found in mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks (i.e.rocks that are low in silica).This is due to the control exerted by silica on the viscosity of a magma: the higher the silica content,the more viscous a magma and the more slowly segregation can proceed.Geological and Geographical Characteristics of Gold Mines.Lode deposits are the result of magna,high temperature and high pressure that thrust liquid gold up from Earth's crust.Cooling water seeping through the metamorphic rocks hardens the gold,resulting in ore deposits that run through sedimentary rocks as veins.Lode deposits are found in old rocks,older than 2.5 billion years,belonging to the.
