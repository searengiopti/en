## Gold processing Britannica
Gold processing,preparation of the ore for use in various products.Native gold is the most common mineral of gold,accounting for about 80 percent of the metal in the Earth's crust.It occasionally is found as nuggets as large as 12 millimetres (0.5 inch) in diameter,and on rare occasions.12.3 Primary Copper Smelting12.3.2 Process Description2 4 Mining produces ores with less than 1 percent copper.Concentration is accomplished at the mine sites by crushing,grinding,and flotation purification,resulting in ore with 15 to 35 percent copper.A continuous process called floatation.

## Where to Sell Gold for Prospectors: Panned Nuggets,Raw.
Secondly,you have to put your gold through a testing process to see how pure it is..this testing process is called "assaying" your gold.Gold that is in the raw form of flakes,nuggets or dust will always have impurities,and you need to find out exactly how pure your panned or prospected gold really is.Terminology Resource Book'Recovery' is the proportion of gold successfully processed into bullion,expressed as a percentage of gold in feed.Ideally the plant would extract 100% of the gold from the ore,but this is not always the case.Small amounts of gold can slip through the net and end up going to tailings.This may be because of: Insufficient grinding.
