## Pulverised Coal Combustion with higher efficiency.
Producing electricity in coal power plants can take place in a number of ways with varying degrees of efficiency.In conventional coal fired plants coal is first pulverised into a fine powder and then combusted at temperatures of between 1300 and 1700 o C.This process heats water in tubes in the boiler so that it becomes steam at a pressure of around 180 bar and a temperature of 540 o C.coal production in india ppt crusherasia.comcoal production in india ppt Crusher Plant,Crushing Plant.ppt of coal excavation process in india Crusher South Africa ;.pulverized coal injection;
