Testing smaller top sized material may lower the numerical results of the test (ASTM,2003 [1]).Aggregates recovered using the ignition furnace appear to be unsuitable for sand equivalent testing because it appears the burning process creates more material that will show up on the sand equivalent test as clay (Prowell and Carter,2000 [3]).NCAT Characterization of Asphalt Binder Extracted from.renewed with rejuvenating chemicals prior to the mix process.Secondly,asphalt mixtures require specific aggregate gradations with specific durability properties.The mineral or ceramic aggregate in RAS provides a source of fine aggregate and reduces the demand for virgin aggregate; however,this reduction of aggregate is small.

## Is there a business case for crushed sand? Metso
Nov 06,2015 · The demand for economical and efficient ways to produce crushed sand is growing as natural sand deposits located near growth centers are depleted and environmental regulations are tightened.At the same time,many aggregates producers are studying the possibility to produce crushed sand and addressing the growing piles of quarry waste that may contain a fair proportion of saleable fine aggregates.ASTM C289 Standard Test Method for. Document Center1.1 This test method covers chemical determination of the potential reactivity of an aggregate with alkalies in portland cement concrete as indicated by the amount of reaction during 24 h at 80°C between 1 N sodium hydroxide solution and aggregate that has been crushed and sieved to pass a 300 μm sieve and be retained on a 150 μm sieve.
