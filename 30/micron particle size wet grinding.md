## Sandpaper Wikipedia
The grit size of sandpaper is usually stated as a number that is inversely related to the particle size.A small number such as 20 or 40 indicates a coarse grit,while a large number such as 1500 indicates a fine grit.Wet and dry sandpaper is more effective used wet because clogging is reduced by particles washing away from the grinding.2 Micron Particle Size Wet Grinding2 Micron Particle Size Wet Grinding; MicroGrinding Systems,Inc.Energy Efficient Vibratory Mills.Any of the VKE mills can be run wet or dry,and configured in multiples with a rod equipped rougher mill feeding two fine grind mills equipped with steel balls,ceramic or any type of media that can be used to grind material down to sub micron particle size.

## Particle Size and Standard Deviation CPM
mean particle size (in microns or µ) is commonly referred to as the "average" or the "micron size".Another common calculation performed in the size analysis procedure is to determine the "log normal standard deviation".For most feed materials ground through a roller mill,the log normalMikro LGM® Long Gap Mill Size Reduction & Milling.The smaller size Mikro LGM® Long Gap Mills are engineered with a split body housing for easy maintenance and cleaning.The LGM processes high moisture materials in wet cake form as well as dry solid feed stocks up to one inch.Finished product particle sizes of D97.10 microns can be achieved.
