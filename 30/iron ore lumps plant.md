## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes.
The various advantages of iron ore pellets are given below.Iron ore pellet is a kind of agglomerated fines which has better tumbling index when compared with the iron ore and it can be used as a substitute for the iron ore lumps both in the BF and for DRI production.Pellets have good reducibility since they have high porosity (25 % to 30 %).TECHNO ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF IRON ORE PELLET.Table 4 : Production of iron Ore by the Non Captive Mines Iron ore Million Tones Percentage recovery Lumps 6.0 66.5 Fines 3.0 33.5 The shortage in supply of iron ore to integrated steel plants from their captive sources is met from these non captive mines.Besides,these mines supply iron ore to sponge iron and mini pig iron

After passing through the wet scrubber units the ore is fed into the screening circuit.The screening circuit sorts the ore into Lump and Fines products.Lump ore produced from the processing plant will range in size from 8mm to 40mm,while Fines ore will be less than 8mm in size.Midrex Process for Direct Reduction of Iron Ore IspatGuruApr 09,2017 · Midrex Process for Direct Reduction of Iron Ore.Midrex is an ironmaking process,developed for the production of direct reduced iron (DRI).It is a gas based shaft furnace process is a solid state reduction process which reduces iron ore pellets or lump ore into DRI without their melting using reducing gas generally formed from natural gas.
