investigations,the nickel was found to occur,at least in part,as native nickel iron.To the best of our knowledge it was first separated and identified in 1938 in asbestos tailings of the Canadian Johns Manville.Company,by Dr.M.H.Haycock,Head of the Ore Mineralogy Section of the Mineral Dressing and Process&nbsp;.Nickel Metal Properties,History,Production &amp; Uses The BalanceOct 9,2017.The separation process for nickel is highly dependent upon the type of ore.Nickel sulphides,such as those found in the Canadian Shield and Siberia,are generally found deep underground,making them labor intensive and expensive to extract.However,the separation process for these ores is much.
