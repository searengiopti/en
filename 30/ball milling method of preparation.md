## Homeopathic Medicine Methods of Preparation by Michael.
The methods of preparation we employ at Hahnemann Laboratories are rooted in the traditional methods used by homeopaths since the days of Dr.Samuel Hahnemann.We do this work with a mechanical device called a ball mill.This is similar in design to something you may be more familiar with called a rock polisher,or rock tumbler.Multiple Factor Analysis on Preparation of Cellulose.These factors included the milling ball size,milling time,mass ratio of milling ball to cellulose pulp,and alkali concentration,as well as their complicated interactions.The Taguchi method was applied to the experimental design to systematically study the influences of these factors on the yield of CNF.
