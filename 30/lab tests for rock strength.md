## FMT Testing procedures TU Graz
FMT Laboratory Testing procedures For example,the uniaxial test is the most frequently used rock mechanics test,but provides only elastic This allows a more realistic evaluation of the intact rock strength,and thus the rock mass strength,Core Laboratories: Core Based Strength LogsCore based strength logs are a non destructive solution to probe relative strength of cores over large depth intervals.Two primary methods used to measure core strength are Brinell hardness and ultrasonic velocity.Both are important in identifying the weakest interval within the formation.

## Estimating Rock Mass Strength BM 1997 02
The strength of jointed rock masses is notoriously difficult to assess.Laboratory tests on core samples are not representative of a rock mass of significantly larger volume.On the other hand,in situ strength testing of the rock mass is seldom practically or economically feasible.Rock mechanics testing equipment,ControlsConfiguration for uniaxial and triaxial tests on rock cores,ADVANTEST and SERCOMP units Digital rock strength index apparatus (Franklin press) Schmidt hammer with rock cradle Rock mechanics is an important field of geotechnical engineering as it is the theoretical and applied science concerning the physical behavior of rocks and rock masses.
