## Gold: The mineral native Gold information and pictures
Gold in its natural mineral form almost always has traces of silver,and may also contain traces of copper and iron.A Gold nugget is usually 70 to 95 percent gold,and the remainder mostly silver.The color of pure Gold is bright golden yellow,but the greater the silver content,the whiter its color is.What is Mineral Processing? (with pictures) wiseGEEKMineral processing,art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock,or gangue.It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.

2019930&ensp&#0183&enspDewatering is an important process in mineral processing.The purpose of dewatering is to remove water absorbed by the particles which increases the pulp density.This is done for a number of reasons,specifically,to enable ore handling and concentrates to be transported easily,allow further processing to occur and to dispose of the gangue.Mica Minerals Education CoalitionMica is a mineral name given to a group of minerals that are physically and chemically similar.They are all silicate minerals,known as sheet silicates because they form in distinct layers.Micas are fairly light and relatively soft,and the sheets and flakes of mica are flexible.Mica is heat resistant and does not conduct electricity.
