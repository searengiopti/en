## What is the difference between an AC motor and a DC motor.
What is the difference between an AC motor and a DC motor? While both A.C.and D.C.motors serve the same function of converting electrical energy into mechanical energy,they are powered,constructed and controlled differently.1 The most basic difference is the power source.A.C.motors are powered from alternating current (A.C.) while D.C.basic construction of dc machine mantelzorgleiderdorp.nlConstruction of dc Machines: The rotor in a dc machine is called an armature.The armature has cylindrical steel core that is composed of a stack of slotted laminations.Slots in laminations are aligned axially along rotor or shaft.Armature windings are placed in slots.
