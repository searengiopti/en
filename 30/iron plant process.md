Schenck Process has been an international expert at iron ore processing.Our applications,ranging from weighing,feeding,screening and automation,are suitable for different kinds of iron ore processing to enhance the iron ore recovery rate.How iron is madeThe process of extracting iron from ore produces great quantities of poisonous and corrosive gases.In practice,these gases are scrubbed and recycled.Inevitably,however,some small amounts of toxic gases escape to the atmosphere.A byproduct of iron purification is slag,which is produced in huge amounts.
