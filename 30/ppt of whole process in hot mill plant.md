## POST HARVESTING PROCESSING Food and Agriculture.
The plate mill is usually limited to about 7kW and is derived from the stone mill or quern.Two chilled iron plates are mounted on a horizontal axis so that one of the plates rotates and the grain is ground between them.The pressure between the two plates governs the fineness of the product and is adjusted by a.ITP Steel: Steel Industry Technology Roadmap Chapter.as the Bessemer process,flourished initially but were then replaced completely.Other processes,such as the blast furnace,electric arc furnace,and hot strip mill,have evolved continuously over the decades and are likely to remain a part of steelmaking in the future.Currently,the two major steelmaking routes use either the basic
