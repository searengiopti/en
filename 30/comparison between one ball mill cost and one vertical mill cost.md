## Ball Mills vs Rod Mills
When the mill is rotated without feed or with very fine feed,the rods are in parallel alignment and in contact with one another for their full length.New feed entering at one end of the mill causes the rod charge to spread at that end.This produces a series of wedge shaped slots tapering toward the discharge end.The tumbling and rolling rods expend most of their crushing force on the.Improving Coal Pulverizer Performance and Reliabilitycoal pulverizer designs are Vertical Roller Mills.Figure 2 shows a cutaway view of a Babcock and Wilcox MPS Pulverizer.Ring Roll and Ball Race Mills A ball or roller between two races or rings provides the grinding surfaces on which pulverization occurs.One or both of the races may rotate against a ball or roll (in a
