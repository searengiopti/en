## Difference Between Granite & Limestone Sciencing
The compressive strength of limestone,however,is more varied,ranging from 15MPa to in excess of 100MPa.Its density,at around 2.6 grams per centimeter cubed,is roughly the same the density of granite.Thanks to its abundance,durability and the ease with which it can be extracted and cut,limestone has long served as an important building.Portland cement WikipediaWhen water is mixed with Portland cement,the product sets in a few hours,and hardens over a period of weeks.These processes can vary widely,depending upon the mix used and the conditions of curing of the product,but a typical concrete sets in about 6 hours and develops a compressive strength of 8 MPa in 24 hours.
