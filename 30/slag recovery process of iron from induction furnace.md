## Bloomery Wikipedia
A bloomery is a type of furnace once used widely for smelting iron from its oxides.The bloomery was the earliest form of smelter capable of smelting iron.A bloomery's product is a porous mass of iron and slag called a bloom.This mix of slag and iron in the bloom is termed sponge iron,which is usually consolidated and further forged into wrought iron.direct chromium alloying by chromite ore with the. doiSerbiaexperiments (100 g and 500 g scale) have been carried out in the induction furnace to further test the effectiveness of using industrial chromite.three steps.In the first step,only chromite ore,carbon,and iron powder were mixed together; and in step two,a slag phase was added,either by mixing well with alloying mixture&nbsp;.
