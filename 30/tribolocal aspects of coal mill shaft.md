The coal miner strike,involving tens of thousands of miners,received prominent national coverage and was not subject to the national security issues that cloaked uranium mining The coal strike led to the passage of both regulations on conditions in the mines and a,Encyclopedia and Handbook of Materials,Parts,and FinishesA great deal of progress has been made in the development of materials,their application to structures,and their adaptation to a variety of systems and integrated across a wide range of industrial applications This encyclopedia serves the rapidly expanding demand for information on technological developments In addition to providing information for manufacturers and assemblers of materials.

## Mining
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth,usually from an ore body,lode,vein,seam,reef or placer deposit.These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.Ores recovered by mining include metals,coal,oil shale,gemstones,limestone,chalk,dimension stone,rock salt,potasEnergies Free Full Text Technique to Investigate,The operating costs of breaking coal particles into fine powder,to achieve optimum combustion for the boilers in a power plant,are made up of power input to carry on an energy intensive comminution mechanism and to overcome friction losses within pulverising machin The operating costs also include the cost of the replacement of the processing system’s components due to wear
