## Surface mining Wikipedia
"Strip mining" is the practice of mining a seam of mineral,by first removing a long strip of overlying soil and rock (the overburden).It is most commonly used to mine coal and lignite (brown coal).Strip mining is only practical when the ore body to be excavated is relatively near the surface.Room and pillar mining WikipediaThe room and pillar system is used in mining coal,iron and base metals ores,particularly when found as manto or blanket deposits,stone and aggregates,talc,soda ash and potash.The key to successful room and pillar mining is in the selection of the optimum pillar size.
