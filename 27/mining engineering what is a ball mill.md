## Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball Mill mech4study
Today we will learn about difference between sag mill vs ball mill.A mill is a machine by which solid or hard materials are broken into smaller pieces by means of grinding,crushing or cutting.This commutation is an essential part of many processes.Various kinds of mills are there with which different material processing takes place.Large Ball Mill Scale Up Factors to be Studied Relative …Ball mills 5.5 m (18 ft) in diameter and larger tend to use energy delivered to the mill less efficiently than smaller diameter mills,particularly when the large mills carry 40% by volume ball charges.This paper will explore factors used in scaling up ball mills,showing where the advantages of one factor can possibly be negated by another factor.The paper will propose possible operating.

## Mill (grinding)
Ball mill.A typical type of fine grinder is the ball mill.A slightly inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls,usually stone or metal,which grind material to the necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls.Ball mills normally operate with an approximate ball charge of 30%.SABC Grinding Circuit Operation &amp; OptimizationWhen operating a grinding circuit (at Granny Smith) under a wide range of conditions: campaigning very competent underground ore followed by soft oxide,primary versus secondary crushed feed and finally single stage SAG and conventional SAG,ball mill and pebble crusher (SABC) configurations.Economics changed and a review of the circuit performance including modelling and simulation resulted.
