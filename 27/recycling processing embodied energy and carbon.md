## Embodied Energy,a Measure of Sustainability
Like the related concept of Energy Returned on Energy Invested or ERoEI (sometimes seen as EREI) embodied energy needs to tackle the thorny issue of boundary considerations and any standards that evolve need to be able to clearly determine what goes in and conversely what stays out of the accounting process and how various factors must be.Embodied energy WikipediaEmbodied energy is the sum of all the energy required to produce any goods or services,considered as if that energy was incorporated or 'embodied' in the product itself.The concept can be useful in determining the effectiveness of energy producing or energy saving devices,or the "real" replacement cost of a building,and,because energy inputs usually entail greenhouse gas emissions,in.
