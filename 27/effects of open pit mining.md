## A Comparative Study of Ground and Underground Vibrations.
With the increase of open pit and underground combined mining and the occasional need of open pit mining,several underground workings may be located in close proximity to an operating open pit mine.In these cases,ground vibrations generated due to open pit blasting may be hazardous to the stability of adjoining underground workings as well.How can metal mining impact the environment? American,Open pit mining disturbs larger areas than underground mining,and thus has larger visual and physical impacts As the amount of waste rock in open pit mines is commonly two to three times the amount of ore produced,tremendous volumes of waste rock are removed from the,
