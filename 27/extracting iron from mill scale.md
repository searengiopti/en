## Study on Milling Periods on the Iron Mill Scale Particle.
The relations between the milling periods with the iron mill scale particle size have been studied.Iron mill scale has been chosen for this research due to the nature of itself,as a by product.From this research,the average optimum size for the final iron mill scale particle size intended to produce is at 300 μm.Raw iron mill scale received from the industries was in the form of chip.Iron Extraction Process DillingerIron Extraction Process.In the blast furnace process,the first step on the way towards heavy plate,pig iron is produced from iron ore.The composition of the ore and additions is accurately adjusted to the final products of AG der Dillinger Hüttenwerke and Saarstahl AG.

## What is a Mill Scale? Definition from Corrosionpedia
Mill scale is a flaky surface that can be found on iron oxides and metals that have been hot rolled.Mill scale forms on exterior surfaces of sheets and plates as they are being manufactured through rolling steel billets and hot iron into rolling mills.Mill scale typically consists of iron oxides that are bluish black.How iron is made material,manufacture,making,history.Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes.The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 92 94% iron and 3 5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.Pig iron has only limited uses,and most of this iron goes on to a steel mill where it is converted into.
