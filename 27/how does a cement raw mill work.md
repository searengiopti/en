## Vertical roller mill
Vertical roller mill is a kind of grinding machine for cement raw material,cement clinker,slag and coal slag.It has the features of simple structure,low cost of manufacture and use.Vertical roller mill has many different forms,but it works basically the same.Cement millA cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage) is the equipment used to grind the hard,nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement.Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.

## Rawmill
A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into &quot;rawmix&quot; during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the.Vertical MillsMcInnis has installed a vertical raw mill for raw meal preparation and two identical vertical finish mills (8,400 tpd) with high efficiency separators between the 120,000 mt of clinker storage and the 120,000 mt of cement storage silos.This enables the plant to remain balanced during times of peak demand.
