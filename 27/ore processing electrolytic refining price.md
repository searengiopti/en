## Electrolytic Refining: Silver
The electrolytic process of gold refining possesses three advantages that are important in mint work.First,it produces purer gold than the old processes.The elimination of the last trace of silver from the gold removes the brittleness from the ingots used for coinage,so that they roll and press much better than alloys of the same fineness in gold,but made of slightly impure gold.EVE Cost Ore Refining Calculator EVE OnlineEVE Cost is a 3rd party tool for manufacturers in EVE Online to help ease all the management stuff a player needs.EVE Time: 03:58:55 31.05.2020 Log in or Register ?
