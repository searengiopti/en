GrabCAD was built on the idea that engineers get better by interacting with other engineers the world over.Ask our Community!Torque Formula (Moment of Inertia and Angular Acceleration)The wheels of a toy car each have a mass of 0.100 kg,and radius 20.0 cm.If the angular acceleration of a wheel is 1.00 radians s 2,what is the torque? Answer: The torque can be found using the torque formula,and the moment of inertia of a solid disc.The torque is: τ = Iα.τ = 0.0020 N∙m.The torque applied to one wheel is 0.0020 N∙m.
