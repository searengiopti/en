## Where do trees get their mass from? MSU Extension
Have you ever wondered where trees get their mass from? One of the more common answers,as seen in the video published in 2012 is that the mass (increasingly bigger size) of a tree comes from the soil.Which makes sense,right? After all,we are taught that plants need soil (enhanced "dirt") to grow.Mass Balancing of Concentrator Data OutotecFrom process sampling to overall circuit mass balance Mass balancing can be done for all process types covering laboratory tests,pilot plant runs and full scale mineral beneficiation plants.In this example the Vammala gold ore flotation plant in southern Finland was sampled for the circuit balance and recovery calculation.

## Mass balance
A mass balance,also called a material balance,is an application of conservation of mass to the analysis of physical systems.By accounting for material entering and leaving a system,mass flows can be identified which might have been unknown,or difficult to measure without this technique.Role of Simulation Software in Design and Operation ofpreliminary heat and mass balance,with equipment sizing based on the mass balance.Detailed Feasibility Study: At this stage,steadystate heat and mass balance software is used to generate flows between unit operations.Greater care and accuracy are required to firm up the selected process options and corresponding equipment.
