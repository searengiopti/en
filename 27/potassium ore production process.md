## US5011672A Process for producing potassium manganate.
Potassium manganate is produced by mixing finely ground manganese ore with a solution of potassium hydroxide (having a concentration of about 50% W V) in a mole ratio KOH MnO 2 between 2 and 3.The resulting suspension is fed continuously to an atomization dryer and then to a plate dryer.Method of controlling potassium chloride production processFIELD: process engineering.SUBSTANCE: invention can be used in production of potassium chloride.Proposed method comprises control over ore feed subject to content of useful component in inlet flows,measurement of ready solution temperature,density,temperature and consumption of dissolving solution.

## Re: How is potassium obtained or extracted?
The potassium is evaporated from the melt and is therefore obtained in a reasonably pure state by distillation.Potash can also be smelted with carbon in a manner analogous to the production of iron.K2CO3 + 2C = 2K +3CO A graphic account of this method was given by W.W.Fisher in 1894 in his Class Book of Elementary Chemistry (2nd edition.Potassium analyzer Berthold TechnologiesPotassium content measurement for the potash industry is one of the most difficult and challenging measurements in the mining industry.It is however essential in the potash production process.Potassium contains the radioactive isotope K 40.This isotope is only found in extremely small quantities in the ore.
