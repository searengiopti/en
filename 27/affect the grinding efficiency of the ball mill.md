## The effect of ball size on the energy efficiency of hybrid.
It is well known that ball mill efficiency is affected by the size of the grinding media and that there is an optimum ball size that is strongly related to particle size.Bond developed an empirical relationship based on maximum breakage rate in which the ideal ball size is proportional to the square root of the product size.Austin et al.and.Effect of ball size and powder loading on the milling,In this figure,the negative influence of the smaller ball size on the milling efficiency is drawn by an arbitrary positive slope with ball size rather than the dependency of d 4,because in an actual dynamic ball mill situation,the balls already existing in the turbulent medium is moving rather than in stationary state,and thus the effect of.
