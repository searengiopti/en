## (PDF) THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF NICKEL LATERITE ORES
The processing of lateritic nickel ore is quite difficult,since the nickel bearing minerals are finely disseminated in the ore bodies.Kn owledge of the mineralogy,morphology andOptimization of Saprolite Ore Composites Reduction …The reduction process is one of the nickel ore processing process using the Pyrometallurgy technique.In addition to the reduction process,the use of composites which are mixing of saprolite ore,coal,additive and bentonite has an important role.There are several factors that influence the reduction process in saprolite ore composites.
