## Bauxite an overview ScienceDirect Topics
During the Bayer's process,bauxite is fine milled As a consequence,the red mud generated has a very fine particle size distribution The particle size analysis of red mud was carried out using a laser particle size analyzer (MASTERSIZER S,Malvern,UK) Figure 142 shows the particle size distribution of red mud received from ALCOA,AustraliaARTICLE: Addressing the Challenge of Bauxite Residue,Mar 11,2019&#0183;&#32;The Bayer Process Though alumina can be produced from bauxite by other chemical processes,the Bayer process is the main industrial route for metallurgical alumina production,as it is the most economical process for purification of bauxite that contains a considerable amount of Fe 2 O 3 Over 95% of the alumina produced globally is derived.
