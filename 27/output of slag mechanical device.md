## Incremental encoder Wikipedia
An incremental encoder is a linear or rotary electromechanical device that has two output signals,A and B,which issue pulses when the device is moved.Together,the A and B signals indicate both the occurrence of and direction of movement.Many incremental encoders have an additional output signal,typically designated index or Z,which indicates the encoder is located at a particular.Pulleys and Mechanical Advantage Systems CMC PROA ratchet is a device that,when attached to an anchor,will hold the rope so that the load will not lower back down when the pulling force is released.This acts as a safety so the load will not fall back down if the haul team lets go of the rope.This also allows us to reset the mechanical advantage pulleys so we can haul the load further.
