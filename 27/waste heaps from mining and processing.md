## heap leach mining process christoartfair.nl
Heap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals such as copper,zinc,cobalt and nickel compounds from ore that has been traditionally mined,crushed and then transported for irrigation on an impermeable leach pad.Mines and environmental impact SGUWaste arising from mining is called gangue.Both surface and underground mining often require large quantities of rock to be broken away to reach the ore.Gangue is usually placed in heaps near the mine.Many Swedish mines use parts of the gangue as a resource,e.g.as aggregate for road construction or to refill mined&nbsp;.

## 4 Uranium Mining,Processing,and Reclamation Uranium.
Key Points • The choice of mining methods and processing parameters for uranium recovery depends on multiple factors that are primarily associated with the geological and geotechnical characteristics of a uranium deposit—its mineralogy and rock type,as well as a range of other factors.Radioactive Waste From Uranium Mining and Milling.Regardless of how uranium is removed from rock,the extraction process creates radioactive wastes.If not managed properly,mining waste and mill tailings can contaminate the environment.Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive element that has been mined and used for its chemical properties.
