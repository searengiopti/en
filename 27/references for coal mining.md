Thousands of products are made with coal or coal by products,including aspirins,soap,dyes,solvents,plastics,and fibers such as rayon or nylon.Coal is an important ingredient in production of products that require activated carbon,carbon fiber or silicon metal.Activated carbon is an essential ingredient in the production of air.Blackdamp WikipediaBlackdamp (also known as stythe or choke damp) is an asphyxiant,reducing the available oxygen content of air to a level incapable of sustaining human or animal life.It is not a single gas but a mixture of unbreathable gases left after oxygen is removed from the air and typically consists of nitrogen,carbon dioxide and water vapour.The suffix damp is believed to derive from the German word.
