The co mmon method of expressing the proportions of ingredients of a concrete mix is in the terms of parts or ratios of cement,fine and coarse aggregates.For e.g.a concrete mix of proportions 1:2:4 means that cement,fine and coarse aggregate are in the ratio 1:2:4 or the mix contains one part of cement,two parts of fine aggregate and four parts of coarse aggregate.Grading of Aggregate aggregate Civil KnowledgesGrading of aggregate.Grading of aggregate is the particle size distribution,which is determined by sieve analysis.The particle size distribution of a mass should be such that,voids between the coarse aggregate should be filled by fine aggregates.The grading of the aggregate affects the workability of concrete.
