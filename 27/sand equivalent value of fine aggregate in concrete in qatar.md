Fine aggregate will be subjected to the Sand Equivalent Test (Test Method Tex 203 F).The sand equivalent shall not be less than 80 unless otherwise shown on the plans.For all classes of concrete,except class K,the fineness modulus shall be between 2.30 and.Fine Aggregate Angularity Pavement InteractiveOverview.The fine aggregate angularity (FAA) test (Figure 1) is an indirect method of assessing the angularity of fine aggregate.Fine aggregate angularity is important because an excess of rounded fine aggregate (often in the form of natural sand) can lead to HMA rutting.Figure 1: Fine aggregate angularity.

## Lightweight concrete
Pumping lightweight concrete can be achieved,but care needs to be taken so that the concrete mix doesn't separate.For pumpable mixes it is usual to use a natural sand,i.e.not to have a lightweight aggregate for the fine portion of the mix and to have a high workability so that increased pump friction and blockage is avoided.Section 902 AGGREGATES mdotcf.state.mi.usFine Aggregate Requirements.a.Fine aggregate includes all aggregates particles passing the No.4 sieve.b.The fine aggregate must meet the requirements of subsection 902.08.902.04.Chip Seal Aggregates.For chip seal,use 34CS aggregate with a maximum moisture content of 4 percent,calculated in accordance with
