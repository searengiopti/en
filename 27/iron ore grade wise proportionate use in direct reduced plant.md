## Royalty on Iron ore An overview with a special reference.
The iron ore is used mainly in blast furnaces,mini blast furnaces (MBF),direct reduced iron (DRI) and sintering and pelletisation plants.Industrial progress and military potential of a country can be judged by its per capita consumption of iron steel.Iron Ore an overview ScienceDirect TopicsAlthough iron ore concentrates are generally higher in iron grade and contain lower impurities,the finer size distribution of concentrates limits their usage in iron ore sintering.Therefore,pelletizing is needed to produce fired pellets from concentrates as burden materials for blast furnaces and direct reduction …

## The Search for Ore Deposits and Chances of Success.
A typical example of this guide is the case of the iron ore deposits of India.Almost all the iron ore deposits occur on top of prominent ridges and other topographical land marks.Thus,in a geologically favourable terrain,iron ores will generally be confined to hill ridge plateau tops and this forms an important field guide for locating them.Iron Ore and it's future MagnetiteIron Ore and it's future.then both have high value in use.We believe that the iron grade.The industry there will be based on direct reduction (DR) of iron.

## Direct Reduced Iron an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Direct reduction (DR) is defined as any process in which metallic iron is produced by the reduction of iron ore at temperatures below the iron melting point.The product of a DR process is called direct reduced iron (DRI).The major consumers of DRI are the smaller steel mills which use DRI to dilute the residual elements present in the steel.Blast furnace WikipediaThe iron making blast furnace itself is built in the form of a tall structure.flue gas is in direct contact with the ore and iron.One of the biggest drawbacks of the blast furnaces is the inevitable carbon dioxide production as iron is reduced from iron oxides by carbon and as of 2016.

The Krupp Renn is an iron ore reduction process designed for low grade ores that at one time had over 40 commercial installations,but high energy costs and availability of higher grade ores led to the shutdown of all operations.Blast furnaceA blast furnace is a type of metallurgical furnace used for smelting to produce industrial metals,generally pig iron,but also others such as lead or copper.Blast refers to the combustion air being &quot;forced&quot; or supplied above atmospheric pressure.[1] In a blast furnace,fuel (coke),ores,and flux (limestone) are continuously supplied through.
