## Gold Extraction and Recovery Processes
The flotation process in general does not float free gold particles but is particularly effective when gold is associated with sulfide minerals such as pyrites.In a typical pyrytic gold ore,the gold is encapsulated within an iron sulfide crystal structure.Highly oxidized ores generally do not respond well to flotation.Processing,smelting and refining gold World Gold …2020 2 25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold.The Miller process is rapid and simple,but it produces gold of only about 99.5 percent purity.The Wohlwill process increases purity to about 99.99 percent by electrolysis.
