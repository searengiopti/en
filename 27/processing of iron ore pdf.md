## Iron Ore
Iron ore minerals,particularly hematite and goethite,are beneficiated by a combination of size fraction,preconcentration,and flotation in stages (Fig.13.45).Iron ore requires removal of silicate impurities of a finer size by flotation for higher grade products of +60% Fe.ROM ore at 400 600 mm is fed to a primary crusher with product set at 40 mm.Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An OverviewThe iron ore pelletizing process consists of three main steps: 1.Pelletizing feed preparation and mixing: the raw material (iron ore concentrate,additives anthracite,dolomite and binders are prepared in terms of particle size and chemical specifications,dosed,and mixed together to feed the pelletizing process; 2.
