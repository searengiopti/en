## Rod Mill an overview ScienceDirect Topics
As such,when the product is sticky,rod mills are preferred over ball mills.Rod mills have an industrial yield that is less than that of a ball mill,which explains the fact that balls have a much larger grinding surface than rods.The power needed to operate a rod mill could exceed 30% of the power used in a ball mill.Ball Mills Mine Engineer.ComIf the peripheral speed of the mill is too great,it begins to act like a centrifuge and the balls do not fall back,but stay on the perimeter of the mill.The point where the mill becomes a centrifuge is called the "Critical Speed",and ball mills usually operate at 65% to 75% of the critical speed.
