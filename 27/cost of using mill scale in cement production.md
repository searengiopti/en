## The Role of Dust Collectors in Cement Production
The production of Portland cement makes up approximately 90% of the total cement produced in the U.S.The main raw materials categories used to make Portland cement are lime,silica,alumina,and iron,but the process also consists of byproducts from other industries such as power plant fly ash,steel mill scale,and metal smelting slag.Cement Analysis and Production Information …Cement Analysis and Production Information.These additives,along with the limestone,are fed from bins to the raw mill.An extremely important step in the cement process is to proportionally feed these materials to the raw mill to ensure the correct “blend” of these materials.This allows cement producers to “mix” low cost.

## Sustainable cement production—present and future.
Cement production has undergone a tremendous development from its beginnings some 2000 years ago.While the use of cement in concrete has a very long history,the industrial production of cements started in the middle of the 19th century,first with shaft kilns,which were later on replaced by rotary kilns as standard equipment worldwide.Uses,Benefits,and Drawbacks of Fly Ash in ConstructionFly ash can be a cost effective substitute for Portland cement in many markets.Fly ash is also recognized as an environmentally friendly material because it is a byproduct and has low embodied energy,the measure of how much energy is consumed in producing and shipping a building material.By contrast,Portland cement has a very high embodied energy because its production requires a great deal.
