This review is designed to assist the decision making and selection process when embarking on a hazard mapping or monitoring exercise.It focuses on the application of optical,LiDAR,and synthetic aperture RADAR technologies for the assessment of pre event risk and post event damage.Application of Differential SAR Interferometry in Mining.Differential synthetic aperture radar Interferometry has been widely applied to monitor mining subsidence for its high spatial resolution,competent accuracy and wide coverage.In this paper,we introduce the principles of InSAR,discuss several key technical issues in mining subsidence monitoring,including selection of SAR images,advanced algorithms for phase unwrapping and.
