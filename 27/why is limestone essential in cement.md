re Role of lime stone in cement? Dear.What Ted has explained is absolutely right.Limestone is no more considered an inert material.World wide studies have shown that limestone takes part in hydration reaction and early strength development in cement.The Role of Calcium Carbonate in Cement Hydration.Palm et al.[7] and Lollini et al.[8] also reported that a lower water cement ratio is the main parameter in cement with high limestone content,which leads to higher solid volume and lower.
