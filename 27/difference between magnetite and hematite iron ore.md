## is hematite the same as iron ore
Iron ore is a mineral substance which,when heated in the presence of a reductant,will yield metallic iron (Fe) It almost always consists of iron oxides,the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3) Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron andthen reacts with the iron ore to form carbon dioxide and pure iron.Separating the iron from the slag 2 The melted iron sinks to the bottom of the furnace.
