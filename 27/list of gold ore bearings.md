When gold dissolution is complete,the gold bearing solution is separated from the solids.With ores of higher gold content (greater than 20 grams of gold per tonne of ore),cyanidation is accomplished by vat leaching,which involves holding a slurry of ore and solvent in large tanks equipped with agitators.What Are the Differences of Rollerblade Bearings?ABEC stands for Annular Bearing Engineering Committee,the committee that rates bearings all over the world.In this system,the scale uses oddnumbered levels 1,3,5,7 and 9,with 9.The higher this number is the tighter the tolerance of the bearing and the better the degree of precision of the bearing.
