An end mill is a type of milling cutter,a cutting tool used in industrial milling applications.It is distinguished from the drill bit in its application,geometry,and manufacture.While a drill bit can only cut in the axial direction,a milling bit can generally cut in all directions,though some cannot cut axially.Types of Milling Cutters Used in Machining Process. · These types of milling cutters have the cutting teeth on the both sides.We use end mill more in the vertical milling processes.High speed steel or the cemented carbide are used to create end mills.High speed steel is also called as HS or HSS.The high speed steel doesn’t loose its hardness when the temperature increases.
