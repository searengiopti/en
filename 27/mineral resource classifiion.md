## Mineral resource classification Wikipedia
Mineral resource classification is the classification of mineral resources based on an increasing level of geological knowledge and confidence.Mineral deposits can be classified as: Mineral resources that are potentially valuable,and for which reasonable prospects exist for eventual economic extraction.; Mineral reserves or Ore reserves are valuable and legally,economically,and technically.Russian Reserves & Resources Reporting System.The outer limits of P1 type resources are determined indirectly by extrapolating from similar known mineral deposits in the area.P1 is the main source from which C2 reserves can be increased.Category P2.Category P2 These resources represent possible mineral structures in known mineral deposits or ore bearing regions.
