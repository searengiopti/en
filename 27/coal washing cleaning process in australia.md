SocraticCoal for export as either coking coal for metallurgical steel making or high value coal for thermal applications does undergo cleaning or preparation as its called,to mostly remove rock particles.A high amount of rock and clay particles reduces the quality and heating value of the coal and usually means a lower price for the mine.
