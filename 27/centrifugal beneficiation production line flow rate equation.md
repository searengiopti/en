## Column Flotation an overview ScienceDirect Topics
A schematic and industrial flotation column are shown in Figure 12.75.The column consists of two distinct zones: the collection zone (also referred to as the recovery or pulp zone) and the froth zone (also referred to as washing or cleaning zone).The collection zone is below the feed point where particles are suspended in the descending water phase and contact a rising swarm of air bubbles.Pump PerformanceThe system head increases as the flow rate increases.The centrifugal pump head,on the other hand,decreases as the flow increases.Hence,there is a certain flow at which both the system and pump head curves match.At this flow rate the pump produces.
