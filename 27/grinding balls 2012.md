Grinding media is grinding feed plus 4 12% ball charge (ball dia.100 125 mm) High capacity (short retention time) Less sensitive to feed composition (critical size material) Semi Autogenous Mill Note the size of the mill: Why does the diameter need to be so big?.AMIT 135: Lesson 6 Grinding Circuit;Effect of ball and feed particle size distribution on the.Khumalo et al.2006 postulated that generally larger sized grinding media would break larger particles quicker but a finer product would be obtained by use of smaller balls.However,use of smaller grinding media is believed to support abrasion and attrition (Katubilwa et al.2011) which are energy inefficient breakage mechanisms.

## Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control
There are three types of grinding media that are commonly used in ball mills: • steel and other metal balls; • metal cylindrical bodies called cylpebs; • ceramic balls with regular or high density.Steel and other metal balls are the most frequently used grinding media with sizes of the balls ranging from 10 to 150 mm in diameter [30].Production of grinding balls resistant to abrasive wear.Low alloy 70KhG chromium manganese steel is investigated.The thermokinetic diagram of supercooled austenite conversion at cooling rates 0.03 8.4&#176;C s is plotted.Appropriate heat treatment is developed for grinding balls of diameter 20 60 mm.The microstructure of the steel formed in heat treatment is analyzed.The temperature at which martensitic transformation begins is determined.
