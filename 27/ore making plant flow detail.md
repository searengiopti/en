2018 7 10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Blast Furnace Plant Now that we have completed a description of the ironmaking process,let s review the physical equipment comprising the blast furnace plant.There is an ore storage yard that can also be an ore dock where boats and barges are unloaded.The raw materials stored in the ore yard are raw ore,several types ofCopper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores.Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.
