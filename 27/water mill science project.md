## How Do Watermills Make Electricity? Sciencing
A water wheel converts the potential energy in a flowing stream or waterfall (mgh) into tangential kinetic energy at the point at which the water makes contact with the wheel.This generates rotational kinetic energy,given by I ω 2 2,where ω is the angular velocity of the wheel and I is the moment of inertia.The moment of inertia of a point rotating around a central axis is proportional.Education Activities > Water,Mills & MarshesEducation Activities.Hello and welcome to the Water,Mills and Marshes (WMM) Education page.We’re in the process of overhauling our entire site (very exciting) but in the meantime this page will be your portal into the wonderful world of the Broads National Park.Natural History Museum Citizen Science Projects.
