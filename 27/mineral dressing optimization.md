## Mineral processing metallurgy Britannica
Mineral processing,art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock,or gangue.It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.An extraordinaire league SlrmMineral Extraction: SLRM joint Venture with Fomento for furthering a safe and scientific mining process riding on the back of state of the art technology.Nevertheless,the Company has cautiously treaded and restricted the growth of colossal ecological human footprints on the environment.
