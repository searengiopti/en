## Slurry
A slurry wall is a technique used to build reinforced concrete walls in areas of soft earth close to open water or with a high ground water table.This technique is typically used to build diaphragm (water blocking) walls surrounding tunnels and open cuts,and to lay foundations.Slurry wall construction was used to construct the “bathtub” that surrounded most of the World Trade Center site.Concrete WikipediaConcrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time.In the past limebased cement binders were often used,such as lime putty,but sometimes with other hydraulic cements,such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete (for its visual resemblance to.
