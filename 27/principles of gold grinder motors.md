## AC Motor Basic Stator and Rotor Operation Diagrams
The term,&quotstator&quot is derived from the word stationary.The stator then is the stationary part of the AC motor.The rotor is the rotating electrical component.It also consists of a group of electromagnets arranged around a cylinder,with the poles facing toward the stator poles.Working Principle of a Single Phase Induction Motor.Working Principle of a Single Phase Induction Motor A Single Phase Induction Motor consists of a single phase winding which is mounted on the stator of the motor and a cage winding placed on the rotor.A pulsating magnetic field is produced,when the stator winding of the single phase induction motor shown below is energised by a single phase supply.
