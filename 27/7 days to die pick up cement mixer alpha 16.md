## sell at the trader for Gold? 7 Days to Die Forums
Yo! In A16 I just created mass Concrete Blocks and sold them to the trader.But now you have to craft them in the cement mixer.So no mass spam possible anymore.I heard that crafting + selling high quality tools is good.But it uses up a lot of duct tape.So what else can I do?PicClick • Search eBay FasterPicClick is an elegant and simple tool that is more enjoyable to use than the built in search tools on eBay.I love eBay,but what I don't love is the crazy amount of scrolling I have to do.Sometimes my searches yield over 20 pages — ugh! If you share my pain,there's a cool solution: PicClick.com.
