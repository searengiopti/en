## Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball Mill
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;SAG mill make use of steel balls included with some large and hard rocks for grinding.These mills utilize the balls in making the large fragments of materials broken into pieces.The ball charge of a SAG mill is about 9% to 20%.This process takes place inside the large rotating drum of SAG mill which is filled with balls partially.SME 2009 Impact on Grinding Mill Design and Recent New.breakage tests do not include ball mill grinding data.Based on the 2009 CIM paper (Starkey and Samuels,2009),the ratio of SAG to ball mill grindability is an important factor in achieving a reliable SAG mill circuit design because that ratio reveals the best and most practical split for SAG and ball mill energy for the ore being tested.
