## How to disperse and stabilize pigments inkline.gr
It is well known,that even well grinded but not stabilized,fine particle size pigment suspension can easily be destroyed by the letting down into a non suitable paint base: flocculation typically breaks down when shear is applied and will form again,when the shear is removed.Therefore,immediately after grinding pigment suspensions must be stabilized by the addition of additives,whether.Effect of grinding time on flotation recovery of…Therefore,to recover their copper by flotation method,grinding should be carried out to obtain optimal particle size.Copper smelting slags in the Bardeskan
