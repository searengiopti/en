## Rolling contact fatigue on the British railway system.
In the late 1990s,rolling contact fatigue was a widespread and severe,but greatly underestimated,problem on the British railway system.In the period 1999 2000,the basis for a system of preventative maintenance of rails was nevertheless established.Preventative maintenance has been greatly accelerated by the tragic and fatal derailment of a passenger train in October 2000.Technical Review UDC 625.143.1 Progress and Prospects.tion of 60K rail,50N rail,etc.this process was also extended to the rolling of switch point rails.Presently,efforts are still underway to improve the dimensional accuracy of rails.2.3.2 Inline heat treatment In the Yawata rail mill,a heat treatment method for rails was de veloped in the 1950s to address the need for high strength.In the

## Rail Grinders
Rail grinders will typically use a coarser stone to work out all of the dips and wear found along the rail head and a finer stone to finish the work and return the rail to a nice,polished finish.A crewman eyes the photographer as a Loram grinder rolls away at Hummelstown,Pennsylvania on March 13,2007.Dynamic Analysis of a Novel Rail Grinding Car Using …In this paper,according to the engineering requirements and constraints,a new fast rail grinding car based on open structured belt grinding technology was designed for the corrugation treatment on high speed railways.A corresponding simulation model was established and its dynamic working performance was then assessed by SIMPACK software.
