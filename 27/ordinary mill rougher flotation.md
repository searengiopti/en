## Froth Flotation Process
Although basic porphyry copper flotation and metallurgy has remained virtually the same for many years,the processing equipment as well as design of the mills has continually been improved to increase production while reducing operating and maintenance costs.Also,considerable attention is paid to automatic sensing devices and automatic controls in order to assure maximum metallurgy and.David MichaudThat earlier rod mill discharge is being fed to a rougher flotation circuit with its rejects flowing to tails and its rougher concentrate going to a multi stage cleaning
