## Gangue Mineral
If the gangue mineral in an iron ore is predominantly quartz,reverse flotation is usually used in the cleaning stage to improve the concentrate grade.Figure 9.13 presents a typical flow sheet for processing an oxidized iron ore containing about 30% Fe using a combination of SLon magnetite separators and reverse flotation.The ore is mainly composed of magnetite,hematite,martite,and quartz.Chromium Minerals Education CoalitionChromium.Chromium (Cr) is a hard,bluish metallic element.The only ore of chromium is the mineral chromite and 99 percent of the world's chromite is found in southern Africa and Zimbabwe.Geologists estimate that there are about 11 billion tons of mineable chromite ore in the world,enough to supply the current demand for hundreds of years.

## Mineral processing Wikipedia
Dewatering is an important process in mineral processing.The purpose of dewatering is to remove water absorbed by the particles which increases the pulp density.This is done for a number of reasons,specifically,to enable ore handling and concentrates to be transported easily,allow further processing to occur and to dispose of the gangue.Mineral processing metallurgy BritannicaMineral processing,art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock,or gangue.It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.The primary operations are comminution and concentration,but there are other important operations.

A solid solution series exists between the mineral chromite (FeCr 2 O 4) and the isomorphous mineral magnesiochromite (MgCr 2 O 4).Intermediate specimens can be rich in iron ((Fe,Mg)Cr 2 O 4) or magnesium ((Mg,Fe)Cr 2 O 4).For convenience in communication,these minerals are often referred to collectively as "chromite."Ore Forming Minerals: Metallic & Non metallic MineralsOre Forming Minerals: Metallic & Non Metallic Minerals.Certain kinds of mineral can be treated for metal extraction more easily than others; these are commonly referred to as ore minerals.Quite often,different minerals containing a particular metal occur together in a deposit,and are referred to as ore forming minerals.Ore minerals form as a result of special geologic processes and often.
