2.6.Military explosives.Military explosives are required to meet stringent criteria because apart from a requirement for high performance,the military needs to be able to safely store them for decades,transport them anywhere from the poles to the equator,handle them under battlefield conditions,and still have them fully functional.Sandline affairThe Sandline affair was a political scandal that became one of the defining moments in the history of Papua New Guinea,and particularly the conflict in Bougainville.It brought down the government of Sir Julius Chan,and took Papua New Guinea to the verge of a military revolt.The event was named

commercial explosives ranges from 0.6 to 1.7 g cc.For free running explosives,the density is often specified as the pounds of explosives per foot of charge length in a given size borehole.With few exceptions,denser explosives give higher detonation velocities and pressures.Density is an important consideration when choosing an explosive.Explosive Dynamite BritannicaExplosive Explosive Dynamite: The second most important of Nobel's inventions was dynamite,in 1867.He coined the name from the Greek dynamis,"power." The basis for the invention was his discovery that kieselguhr,a porous siliceous earth,would absorb large quantities of nitroglycerin,giving a product that was much safer to handle and easier to use than nitroglycerin alone.

## The Difference Between Deflagration and Detonation
Combustion (burning) is a process by which energy is released.Deflagration and detonation are two ways energy may be released.If the combustion process propagates outward at subsonic speeds (slower than the speed of sound),it's a deflagration.If the explosion moves outward at supersonic speeds (faster than the speed of sound),it's a detonation.High and low Explosives Your source for military.HIGH AND LOW EXPLOSIVES.Military explosives are divided into two general classes,high explosives and low explosives,according to their rate of decomposition.High Explosives.High explosives are usually nitration products of organic substances,such as toluene,phenol,pentaerythritol,arnines,glycerin.
