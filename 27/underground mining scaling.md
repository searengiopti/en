## Mining Underground mining Britannica
Mining Mining Underground mining: When any ore body lies a considerable distance below the surface,the amount of waste that has to be removed in order to uncover the ore through surface mining becomes prohibitive,and underground techniques must be considered.Counting against underground mining are the costs,which,for each ton of material mined,are much higher underground than on.Mechanised scaling solutions in the mining industryMikko Yletyinen: Manual scaling has always been the most dangerous task in underground mining.Imminent rock falls are the most obvious risk but there is more to it than that.For example,working in unergonomic positions,such as carrying a long scaling bar and hitting rock surfaces which can strain a miner’s muscles,joints and tendons.

Abutment — In coal mining,(1) the weight of the rocks above a narrow roadway is transferred to the solid coal along the sides,which act as abutments of the arch of strata spanning the roadway; and (2) the weight of the rocks over a longwall face is transferred to the front abutment,that is,the solid coal ahead of the face and the back abutment,that is,the settled packs behind the face.Hard Rock EquipmentHard rock equipment We have an extensive product suite of hard rock mining equipment,including hydraulic jumbo drills,drifters,loaders,and trucks.In addition,we offer a full line of raiseboring tools and blasthole drilling tools.
