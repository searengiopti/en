## Ball Mill
According to the material and the way of discharging,users can choose a dry or a wet grid ball mill according to their materials and discharging methods.The wet ball mill is often equipped with a classifier whereas the dry one with a suction and separating device.Compared with the Raymond mill,the ball mill can grind metal ore.Where Dry Milling Makes Sense : Modern Machine Shop · This characteristic of ball nose tools creates a danger whenever two conditions are met—(A) the cut is very light,and (B) the workpiece surface is nearly perpendicular to the axis of the tool.Under these conditions,the tip of the tool is not truly "milling" so much as being dragged across the workpiece surface.
