Second Survey Described in 1924 as “the most remarkable series of reports ever issued by any survey," the Second Geological Survey of Pennsylvania (1874 1889) produced an unprecedented volume and quality of geologic reports With over 80 texts,nearly 600 accompanying maps and illustrations,a hand atlas,a six volume grand atlas,and miscellaneous other publications,the Second Survey.Coal Ash — Mobile BaykeeperCoal ash is the toxic byproduct of coal burning power plants Power plants typically mix the ash with water and dump it in massive “ponds” or pits nearby Toxic pollutants commonly found in coal ash include heavy metals such as arsenic,mercury,selenium,chromium,and lead,which are hazardous to human health,wildlife,and waterways

## Coal: Anthracite,Bituminous,Coke,Pictures,Formation,Uses
What is Coal? Coal is an organic sedimentary rock that forms from the accumulation and preservation of plant materials,usually in a swamp environment.Coal is a combustible rock and,along with oil and natural gas,it is one of the three most important fossil fuels.Coal has a wide range of uses; the most important use is for the generation of electricity.Fossil Focus: Coal swamps PALAEONTOLOGY[online]It is thought that this reflects the extinction of coal forming ecosystems,and that it took many millions of years before new groups of plants adapted to create wetland peat forming habitats.Suggestions for further reading: Cleal,C.J.& Thomas,B.A.1994.Plant Fossils of the British Coal Measures.Dorchester: The Palaeontological Association.
