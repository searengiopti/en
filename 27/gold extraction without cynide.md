## Extraction of gold using cyanide NZQA
Extraction of gold using cyanide Gold is found in very low concentrations in the ore from which it is mined.To collect the gold from the ore it needs to be separated from the other minerals in the ore.To do this the gold needs to be made into a soluble form so that it can be separated from the other minerals as gold is insoluble.The Borax Method of Gold Extraction for Small Scale Minersof gold extraction for SSM.Methods.Borax was added to milled ore to reduce the melting point of gold to a level accessible to SSM.The amount of gold captured,and the amount of mercury released into the environment,was compared to two common amalgamation.

## What is Gold Cyanidation? (with picture) wiseGEEK
May 16,2020 · Gold cyanidation,also called cyanide leaching,is a process used to extract gold from raw ore taken from the ground.It uses cyanide to dissolve the gold within the rock,which,itself,is not soluble in cyanide.The gold is then drawn out in a liquid form that can be treated to remove the cyanide.extracting gold with cyanideAt present,most cyanidation gold extraction plants use cyanide as gold extraction reagent.As is well known,cyanide is a kind of highly toxic hazardous chemical,so any misoperation in transportation,storage,use and other links will cause the events of serious environmental pollution,malignant poisoning,etc.
