## Characterization and Pre Concentration of Low Grade.
A large number of unexploited low grade vanadium titanium magnetite deposits have been found in the Chao yang area of China in recent years.The reserves are estimated at more than 20 billion tons.A mineralogical study of raw sample indicated that it was a typical low grade vanadium titanium magnetite ore with weathering.Most of vanadium titanium magnetite was replaced by martite and sphene.High Intensity Dry Roll Magnetic SeparatorThe rare earth roll magnetic separator is designed to provide peak separation efficiency and is typically used when a high purity product is required.The roll is constructed of thin neodymium boron iron permanent magnetic discs sandwiched with thin steel pole
