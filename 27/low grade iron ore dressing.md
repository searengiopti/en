## Iron ore Wikipedia
Lower grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation,using techniques like crushing,milling,gravity or heavy media separation,screening,and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities.The results,high quality fine ore powders,are known as fines.Magnetite.Magnetite is magnetic,and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and.Advances of Iron Ore Beneficiation in ChinaChina has large amounts of iron ore reserves,but iron ore in China,with low grade,small disseminated particles and many other associated minerals,is difficult to dress.In recent years,with the fast development of China’s steel industry,the demand for iron ore has increased markedly.The new technologies in iron ore dressing in China.
