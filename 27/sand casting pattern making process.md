## Different Types of Casting Processes used in Manufacturing
Plaster casting is similar to the sand casting process,using a mixture of gypsum,strengthening compound,and water in place of the sand.The plaster pattern is typically coated with an anti adhesive compound to prevent it from becoming stuck against the mold,and the plaster is capable of filling in any gaps around the mold.Rapid Tooling in Metal Casting2003 5 7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The cavity in the sand is formed by using a pattern.A pattern,which has approximately the same shape as an actual casting,is the main tooling in the process of sand molding.Patterns in sand casting are typically made out of wood,plastic,or metal (since pattern material dictates pattern life,its selection depends on the volume of production).
