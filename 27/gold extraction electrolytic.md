## Wohlwill process Wikipedia
The Wohlwill process is an industrial scale chemical procedure used to refine gold to the highest degree of purity (99.999%).The process was invented in 1874 by Emil Wohlwill.This electrochemical process involves using a cast gold ingot,often called a Doré bar,of 95%+ gold to serve as an anode.Lower percentages of gold in the anode will interfere with the reaction,especially when the.How to Melt Gold Out of Rocks SciencingGold and mercury quickly form an alloy,so people have used mercury amalgamation for centuries to extract gold from ore.The ore must be thoroughly clean to ensure optimum contact between the gold in the ore and the introduced mercury.One way to clean it is to wash the ore in a solution of nitric acid.Mercury can be introduced in several ways.
