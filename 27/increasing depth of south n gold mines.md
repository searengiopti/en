Dust concentrations in South African gold mines have always been low for the following reasons: (i) wet mining was introduced by Regulation no.101 framed under The Mines and Works Act of 1911 to cover rock drilling and the removal of broken rock (,p.223Barometric hazards within the context of deep level miningdepth.Hypobaric conditions can cause adverse health effects from low partial pressure of oxygen,whereas hyperbaric conditions can result in narcosis from inert gases or toxicity of oxygen and carbon dioxide (Popendorf,1997).Due to ever increasing working depths,the South African gold mining industry has periodically examined the potential.
