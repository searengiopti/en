## What is cut off grade? An introduction to overlooked yet.
A cut off grade is proposed,and then the parameters of the deposit are calculated,and tested against economic scenarios.If it fails the process is started again with a different cut off grade.In some cases it may never work.In summary,cut off grade is one of the most important,yet least understood variables for making an investment decision.Kaolin deposits of the Charentes Basin Wikipedia[citation needed] In deposits with sharp contacts,the geometry may be relatively simple,nevertheless,there is always uncertainty caused by lack of information and large drill hole grid.Generally,these boundaries are determined by mineral grade rather than geological properties: deposit boundaries are chosen based on the cut off grade.

This is a sedimentary rock with a high feldspar content (usually orthoclase or microcline),derived from weathering of feldspar rich rocks like granites and gneisses.It contains some rock fragments and micas in a fine grained matrix.Red colouration is caused by the presence of hematite and iron staining.Mining Valuation Lesson: Cut Off Grade Theory and Practice.Dec 04,2011 · Applying the theory of cut off grade to a gold mine to see how it affects mine life and more.If all the tonnes of ore in a deposit contained the exact same grade of gold,it would be easy to calculate.But not all the tonnes of ore that make an orebody contain the same grade of gold.As a matter of fact,gold deposits may vary the most in.

Cut off grade is typically at 100 ppm.Among other applications,scandium is useful as a grain refiner in high strength aluminium alloys (e.g.in sports equipment),and in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs),which convert stored chemical energy (such as hydrogen or hydrocarbons) to useable electrical energy.
