A Sprocket Drive utilizes a sprocket with an integral shear pin hub which engages and drives the power chain of an overhead conveyor system.For use in horizontal turns,a sprocket drive requires a 90 degree chain wrap as the minimum with 180 degree chain wraps often used.5.Chain Speed John King Chains Conveyor ChainChain speed,normally calculated in feet or metres per minute,is a critical consideration in determining the conveyor capacity.It is in considering this parameter that conveyor chain pitch and conveyor chain drive and idler sprocket can be determined.fig.5.1 illustrates the relationship between speed,chain.
