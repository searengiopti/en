## Mining Industry: What's the working principle of grinding.
Since grinding mill has many types.Here I will explain grinding ball mill principle.【Ball grinding mill Principle】 When the ball mill works,motor and speed reducer transmit torque force to big and small gears of ball mill,so the barrel rotates.Back to Basics Hammer Milling and Jet Milling Fundamentalssolution is to dry the material prior to grinding,or dry and grind it at the same time by sweeping hot air through the mill.As an alternative,water can be added to the material and it can be ground wet; this solution is suitable for ham mer mill operation but not for jet mills.Melting point and thermal instability.Jet mills can grind
