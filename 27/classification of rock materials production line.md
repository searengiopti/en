## Limestone Wikipedia
Limestone is a carbonate sedimentary rock that is often composed of the skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral,foraminifera,and molluscs.Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite,which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).A closely related rock is dolomite,which contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite,CaMg(CO 3) 2.classification of rock materials production lineRock materials are generally classified based on their strength values,especially from uniaxial compressive strength (Singh and Goel,2011).However,the lithology of the material is the dominant factor in the material's strength,so classification depends on the quantification rather than the qualification of the material.
