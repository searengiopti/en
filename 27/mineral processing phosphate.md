## MEI Blog: New Book Beneficiation of Phosphate Ore
Beneficiation of Phosphate Ore,by S.Komar Kawara and J.T.Carlson,examines various methods for processing phosphate rock,an important mineral commodity used in the production of phosphoric acid.The majority of phosphoric acid is produced by the wet process,in which phosphate rock is reacted with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid and gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate).Mineral ProcessingMineral Processing.Mineral Processing includes recovery operations at a mine site and the associated processing plant.The processing operations involve the extraction of metal ores and minerals from the mined rock.Mines use mixers in Backfill or Water Treatment operation.Major applications involving mixers and agitators are found in the.

## Phosphorite
Phosphorite,phosphate rock or rock phosphate is a non detrital sedimentary rock that contains high amounts of phosphate minerals.The phosphate content of phosphorite (or grade of phosphate rock) varies greatly,from 4%[1] to 20% phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5).Marketed phosphate rock is enriched (&quot;beneficiated&quot;) to at least 28%,often more than.BeneficiationIn the mining industry or extractive metallurgy,beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals,which results in a higher grade product (concentrate) and a waste stream ().There are many different types of beneficiation,with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.
