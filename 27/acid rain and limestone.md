## What Does Acid Rain Do to Limestone? eHow
As acid rain falls to the earth's surface,limestone rocks and limestone components in soil will react with the rain,neutralize the acid and dissolve.As the limestone dissolves,the rocks will wear away,becoming pitted with rounded edges.The dissolution process will change the appearance of the landscape as the rocks slowly wear away over time.Acid Rain Adirondack CouncilAcid Rain is any type of precipitation with acidic components that falls to the ground from the atmosphere.It can be wet or dry.When nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (NO2) are released into the atmosphere,they react with water and create sulfuric and nitric acids.
