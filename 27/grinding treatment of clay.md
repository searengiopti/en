## The method of grinding claylike material russianpatents
The invention is: to improve the quality of the finished product is proposed a method of grinding the claylike material with simultaneous drying by mechanical action on the material in a stream of hot air,in which the source material is fed to the processing in the form of granules with a size 8 10 mm,after mechanical blade grinderDry Grinding VS Wet GrindingFinally,clays for the preparation of ceramic slips would reasonably be expected to be ground wet,since the initial condition of the clay is wet and it is required in a wet form for subsequent processing.Clearly,in such a case,dry grinding,which would involve drying,would be uneconomic and would only be adopted in very special circumstances.
