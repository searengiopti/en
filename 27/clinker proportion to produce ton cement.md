## Energy efficiency in cement manufacture VDZ
Manufacturing cement is highly energy intensive.First,energy is used in the form of fuel to fire the rotary kilns to produce the cement clinker.Second,electrical energy is used to operate various units in particular raw material and cement grinding systems.Cement Clinker Grinding Plant in IndiaThis product is very useful in construction and engineering works of housing,buildings,bridges and cement concrete roads.Grinding of clinker is the last and most energy consuming stage of the cement manufacturing process,drawing on average 40% of the total energy required to produce one ton of cement.

(with pictures)Apr 20,2020 · Cement clinkers are formed by the heat processing of cement elements in a kiln.Limestone,clay,bauxite,and iron ore sand in specific proportions are heated in a rotating kiln at 2,770° Fahrenheit (1,400° Celsius) until they begin to form cinder lumps,which are also known as cement clinkers.These are usually ground with gypsum to produce the fine powder later mixed with liquid to produce.
