## Baryte Wikipedia
20191011&ensp&#0183&enspBaryte or barite (UK: ˈ b &#230r ʌ ɪ t , ˈ b ɛər aɪ t [citation needed]) is a mineral consisting of barium sulfate (Ba S O 4).Baryte is generally white or colorless,and is the main source of barium.The baryte group consists of baryte,celestine (strontium sulfate),anglesite (lead sulfate),and anhydrite (calcium sulfate).Flotation of barite oresThis invention relates to the flotation of mineral values from low grade ores.In particular,it relates to an improved process of concentrating the barite content of those ores and mill products which because of their tendency to slime are not amenable to ordinary methods of froth flotation.
