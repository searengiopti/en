## Technical Resource Document: Extraction and Beneficiation.
Recovery Act (RCRA) as it applies to mining waste was amended in 1980 when Congress passed the Bevill Amendment,Section 3001(b)(3)(A).The Bevill Amendment states that "solid waste from extraction,beneficiation,and processing of ores and minerals" is excluded from the definition of hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA (40 CFR 261.4(b)(7)).TENORM: Copper Mining and Production Wastes Radiation.Mining and Processing Methods.Ores that contain copper in the U.S.are typically mined in large,open pits.Copper processing facilities are usually located near mining or extraction sites.Significant waste volumes are associated with copper production.

## Vermiculite
Vermiculite is mined from a separate pit,located adjacent to the copper pit.The mining operation involves blasting the ore in the pit,which is approximately 50 metres deep,loading the ore onto trucks,and transporting it to the surface,where it is then sent to the nearby Vermiculite Plant.The pit is a lot shallower than the open copper pit.Copper Mining and Processing: Life Cycle of a MinePlans are assessed regarding the: 1) the mining process technology that will be used,2) building of access roads for transportation,3) identification of resources such as power and water sources,and 4) construction of ore processing.
