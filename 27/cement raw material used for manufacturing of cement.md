## White Cement Manufacture,Properties and Uses
The manufacturing process of white cement is same as that of grey cement,but the selection of raw material is an important part in the manufacturing process.The oxides of chromium,manganese,iron,copper,vanadium,nickel and titanium imparts the grey colour to the cement.How concrete block is made material,manufacture,used.Today,concrete block manufacturing is a highly automated process that can produce up to 2,000 blocks per hour.Raw Materials The concrete commonly used to make concrete blocks is a mixture of powdered portland cement,water,sand,and gravel.This produces a light gray block with a fine surface texture and a high compressive strength.
