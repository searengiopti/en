Grinding media type is a critical factor in determining the chemistry of the flotation feed pulp and yet is infrequently studied in this regard by plant operators.The normal operating philosophy is to choose the grinding media which produces the correct grind at m i n i m u m economic cost,and adjust the chemistry by reagents and or aeration.QUANTIFYING THE ADDITIONAL ENERGY CONSUMED BY.The database also contains limited data for both ancillary equipment power and embodied energy of grinding media.However,as the database does not contain ancillary and embodied energy data for all the circuits,simplified models were required to populate circuits where these figures were not known.
