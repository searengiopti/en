## Compressive strength Wikipedia
Compressive strength or compression strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size,as opposed to tensile strength,which withstands loads tending to elongate.In other words,compressive strength resists compression (being pushed together),whereas tensile strength resists tension (being pulled apart).In the study of strength of materials.Compressive Strength of Concrete Test procedure Civil.The compressive strength of concrete is given in terms of the characteristic compressive strength of 150 mm size cubes tested at 28 days The characteristic strength is defined as the strength of the concrete below which not more than 5% of the test results are expected to fall."
