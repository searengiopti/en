## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotatithe factors affecting the efficiency of ball mill grindingFactors Affecting the Efficiency of Ball Mill College Essays.Ball mill is the key equipment for grinding after the crush process,and it is widely used in the manufacture industries,such as cement,silicate,new building.
