## Durability performance of concrete incorporating coarse.
Despite the successful use of marble dust,there is little information on the potential use of larger marble waste as a coarse aggregate,especially with respect to its effect on concrete durability.However,Akbulut and Gurer (2007) explored this potential and concluded that CMA can be used in binder layers of asphalt pavements bearing low to.Assessment for Sustainable Use of Quarry Fines as …For flexible pavements,quarry fines have been utilized to improve physical,mechanical,and swelling properties of soil subgrade and subbase.Extended research attempts have been made to utilize quarry waste in constructions for both non bearing [21,29] and structural purposes [20,22,23,29,30,31].Non bearing blocks made of quarry waste and.
