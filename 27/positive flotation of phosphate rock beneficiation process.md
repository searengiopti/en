## Beneficiation Wikipedia
In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy,beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals,which results in a higher grade product ( concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ).Examples of beneficiation processes include froth flotation and gravity separation.Fatty acid collectors for phosphate flotation and their.To improve phosphate flotation especially with regard to reduction of consumption of collector the relationship between the flotation performance of phosphate collectors and their adsorption behaviour was evaluating using a variety of techniques including Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation technique (QCM D),a highly sensitive method for in situ surface characterization.
