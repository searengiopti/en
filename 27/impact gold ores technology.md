## Bioleaching Wikipedia
Bioleaching is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms.This is much cleaner than the traditional heap leaching using cyanide.Bioleaching is one of several applications within biohydrometallurgy and several methods are used to recover copper,zinc,lead,arsenic,antimony,nickel,molybdenum,gold,silver,and cobaltGold Ore Processing ScienceDirectPressure oxidation of gold ores is therefore a pretreatment leaching step to enhance gold recovery.Although pressure oxidation of gold ores and concentrates does not directly recover gold in a strict sense of the above definition,it is an essential step to enable the gold to be recovered.
