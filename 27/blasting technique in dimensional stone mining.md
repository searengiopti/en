## Controlling Measures of Damages due to Various Blasting
Blasting techniques such as cushion blasting,presplitting,smooth blasting are used to control the unwanted cracks in the remaining rock in conventional blasting.But these techniques develop micro level cracks which are not desirable in dimensional stone extraction.Thus,an improved and cost effective technique is requiredMiningMining Mining Surface mining: It has been estimated that more than two thirds of the world’s yearly mineral production is extracted by surface mining.There are several types of surface mining,but the three most common are open pit mining,strip mining,and quarrying.These differ from one another in the mine geometries created,the techniques used,and the minerals produced.Open pit.
