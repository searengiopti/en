## Mophorn Mini Milling Machine 2500PRM 550W Variable Speed.
550W Mini Milling Drilling Machine Digital Display Adjustable Stops Gear Drive Motor.Our mini drilling milling machine with lathe bed can handle most materials.It features a 550watt motor with variable speed drive.The working table with t slots enables to clamp workpieces and metric graduated compound scales.M.Keyßner,T.Fahrland,Loesche GmbH,Duesseldorf.The drive of a vertical roller mill essentially the mill gearbox has to fulfill two tasks: The first is to reduce the speed of the electric motor to the selected mill speed and to transmit the torque created by the motor.Secondly,the gearbox has to transmit the grinding forces generated by the grinding rollers,from the mill table.
