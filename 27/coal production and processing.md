## ch4 emissions: coal mining and handling ipcc nggip
1.1.1 Overview of emissions from coal mining and handling.Methane (CH4) is produced during coalification (the process of coal formation).Only a fraction of this remains trapped under pressure in the coal seam and surrounding rock strata.This trapped methane is released during the mining process when the coal seam is.What Are the Four Stages in Coal Formation? ReferenceStage two of the coal formation process is lignite.Lignite forms when peat is put under considerable vertical pressure.It contains small amounts of plant matter and is very fragile so it must never be handled before burning.Bituminous coal is the third stage of coal production.
