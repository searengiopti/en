## Magnetic core memory Wikipedia
Magnetic core memory was the predominant form of random access computer memory for 20 years between about 1955 and 1975.It was part of a family of related technologies which bridged the gap between vacuum tubes and semiconductors by exploiting the magnetic properties of materials to perform switching and amplification.Such memory is often just called core memory,or,informally,core.In Incorporated Magnetic Material Patents and Patent.According to the invention the security element has at least two magnetic materials,wherein the magnetic materials have different coercive field strengths and are applied onto and or incorporated in the security element in such a manner that their remanence is equally high.
