## What Is Copper Smelting? (with pictures)
 · The resulting copper from this step is known as blister copper.Blister copper undergoes further firing and purification to remove any remaining impurities.One of the main side effects of the copper smelting process is the production of waste.Refining copper results in three and a half times as much waste as the amount of copper produced.Copper in the USA: Copper ProducersCopper in the USA: Bright Future Glorious Past Copper Producers.At the beginning of copper's flow through the economy are the mining companies,which process vast quantities of low grade ore,mostly from open pit mines in order to produce copper.
