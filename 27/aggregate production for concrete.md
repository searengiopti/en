## Concrete blocks Manufacturing & Uses of Concrete block
Sep 01,2015 · The materials required for the production of the concrete blocks are aggregates,cement and water.The aggregates of various types have been used with varying degree of success and they include crushed stones,gravel,volcanic cinders,foamed slag,furnace clinker,etc.Local Aggregate in Production of Concrete Mix in JordanAggregate,Concrete,Mix Production,Compressive Strength,Concrete Age.1.Introduction.Recently,production and utilization of concrete are rapidly increasing,which results in increased consumption of natural aggregate as the largest concrete component.For example,two billion tons of aggregate are produced each year in the United States.
