## Optimizing Conveyor Take up Systems using Dynamic.
STATIC vs.DYNAMIC CALCULATIONS Static conveyor calculations are used to determine the steady state belt tensions,power consumption,and general equipment selection for a conveyor system.Static analysis assumes that the conveyor acts as an inelastic body (CEMA,1997).With this assumption both acceleration and deceleration forces can be.Gearmotor for chain conveyor driveCalculation of load moment of inertia 5.1 Calculation result (load moment of inertia) ① Moment of inertia of carrier and chain or belt (Converted in a motor shaft) JW = kg･m 2 JW＝（（W＋B）／4）&#215;（D&#215;P2.
