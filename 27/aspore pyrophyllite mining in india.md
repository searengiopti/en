## Alumino Silicate Pyrophyllite Powder Manufacturers.
Pyrophyllite.Pyrophyllite is natural Hydrated Alumino Silicate mineral with unique properties of a fire clay.Due to its low expansion properties the mineral expands less on heating than other refractory materials.Traditionally pyrophyllite has been used as a refractory and foundry mineral only.Dolomite Powder Manufacturer,Supplier & Exporter in.Dolomite structure is formed by an ionic interaction of Mg2+ (magnesium cation),Ca2+ (calcium cation),and CO32 (carbonate anion).For every two carbonate anions there is one magnesium cation and one calcium cation,thereby making the structure electrically neutral.

## Talc and Pyrophyllite Statistics and Information
The mineral talc is a hydrous magnesium silicate.A massive talcose rock is called steatite,and an impure massive variety is known as soapstone.Talc is used commercially because of its fragrance retention,luster,purity,softness,and whiteness.Other commercially important properties of talc are its chemical inertness,high dielectric strength,high thermalIndia Industrial Production 1994 2020 Data 2021 2022.India's industrial production plunged 16.7 percent year on year in March 2020,the steepest decline since records began in 1994 and much worse than market expectations of an 8.7 percent tumble,as the COVID 19 pandemic forced many businesses to close.Manufacturing production contracted at a record pace ( 20.6 percent vs 3.1 percent) and electricity output also fell ( 6.8 percent vs 11.5 percent).
