## Should cyanide still be used in modern day mining?
Mar 07,2016 · The concentration of cyanide used in processing is very diluted.Toxic sodium cyanide has been used in gold mining since 1887,and it remains the primary reagent in use for gold processing today because it allows for efficient extraction of gold from low grade ore.Cyanide Plants in South Kordofan State: Human Life is a.Cyanide Plants in South Kordofan State: Human Life is a Price for Gold Extraction Introduction: After South Sudan’s independence and the Sudanese government’s loss of oil revenues from the South,gold has become a major resource for the country’s budget,and as a result Sudan’s gold production has increased steadily.
