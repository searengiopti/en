## Gravel Extraction an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Offshore sand and gravel extraction involves the abstraction of sediments from a bed which is always covered with seawater.This activity started in the early twentieth century (in the mid 1920s,in the UK),but did not reach a significant scale until the 1960s and 1970s,when markets for marine sand and gravel expanded and dredging technology improved (Figure 1).
