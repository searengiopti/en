## Mercury free gold mining technologies
Gold extraction using mercury is comprised of the following four stages: (1) amalgamation,(2) separation of amalgamation,(3) removal of excess mercury,and (4) burning of the remaining amalgam to produce a gold sponge.Mercury can be released into the environment at each stage,which makes the promotion of mercury free alternatives imperative.Mercury Free Gold Extraction Using Borax for Small Scale.a mercury free gold extraction method,and during the following years around 20,000 miners in that area adopted the new process.The method,whichis based on gravitational concentration of heavy minerals,works as follows.
