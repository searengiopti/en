## Gradation of Coarse Aggregates
• Well graded: Wellgraded aggregate has a gradation of particle size that fairly evenly spans the size from the finest to the coarsest.A slice of a core of wellgraded aggregate concrete shows a packed field of many different particle sizes.It is characterized by the S shaped in gradation curve.Aggregates for Use In Concrete• FM of coarse aggregate can also be calculated and can aid in blending coarse and medium size materials FM &amp; Gradation are NOT the SAME 30 Fine Aggregate Gradation • Fineness Modulus (FM) should be between 2.3 and 3.1 • FM is empirical # the sum
