## physical properties of artificial sand in concrete.
Concrete Wikipedia,the free encyclopedia.Concrete is a composite material composed mainly of water,aggregate,and cement Often,additives and reinforcements are included in the mixture to achieve the desired physical properties of the finished material When these ingredients are mixed together,they form a fluid mass that is easily molded.Aggregate2020 2 22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Aggregate ” is a collective term for the mineral materials such as sand,gravel and crushed stone that are used with a binding medium (such as water,bitumen,portland cement,lime,etc.) to form compound materials (such as asphalt concrete and portland cement concrete).By volume,aggregate generally accounts for 92 to 96 percent of HMA and about 70 to 80 percent of portland cement concrete.
