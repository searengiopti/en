Mercury is also extensively used in the gold mining process as an amalgam for separating gold from ore.When mercury is combined with gold silt,it causes a reaction that separates the gold from the ore.This amalgam is then heated in order to evaporate the mercury and leave the gold pieces.Separation of mercury from VOC’s and selective …Separation of mercury from VOC’s and selective detection using gold film amalgamation and photoionization 1.Separation of mercury from VOC’s andSeparation of mercury from VOC’s and selective detection using gold filmselective detection using gold film amalgamation and photoionizationamalgamation and photoionization Dr.Jack N.Driscoll &amp; Jennifer Maclachlan PID …

## Why does mercury dissolve many metals (such as gold.
 · Mercury does not actually dissolve metals,it reacts with them in a process called amalgamation (Amalgam (chemistry)).The formation of mercury alloys is not quite like a reaction but rather a mixture (alloy) of metals similar to table salt going.How to Melt Gold Out of Rocks SciencingGold and mercury quickly form an alloy,so people have used mercury amalgamation for centuries to extract gold from ore.The ore must be thoroughly clean to ensure optimum contact between the gold in the ore and the introduced mercury.One way to clean it is to wash the ore in a solution of nitric acid.

## Extraction of Gold
The ore is reduced to a fine state of division and amalgamated simultaneously in a stamp mill,the solid gold amalgam separated from the liquid mercury by filtration through leather under pressure,and the mercury distilled.Complete extraction of the gold by amalgamation is impossible,a part remaining in the mud of the stamp mills.Gold,Mercury,and Silver Extraction by Chemical and.Although mercury amalgamation in gold extraction has been officially prohibited in many countries (Kozin and Hansen,2013),it is still widely practised in many artisanal and small scale gold.

## Separating Platinum from Gold During the Early Eighteenth.
The amalgamation method of separation is based upon the fact that the solubility of the platinum group metals in mercury is low,while the solubility of gold is high.Platinum and palladium,the lower melting points metals in the platinum group,form intermetallic compounds with mercury.PARTING: Separate Gold and Silver by MeltingParting is the separation of silver from gold and a process during which the base metals are separated from both,but,as the presence of a high percentage of these base metals is injurious to the successful conduct of the processes which are chiefly in use,a preliminary refining by one of the methods already described is usually necessary.

## How to Melt Gold Out of Rocks Sciencing
You can't actually melt gold from rocks; if you hold a rock over a flame hot enough to melt gold and expect the gold to dribble out,you're going to be disappointed.The process of extracting gold from ore is a multistep one,and historically it has involved the use of some dangerous chemicals,including cyanide and mercury.How Is Mercury Used to Purify Gold? SciencingMiners submerged their ore in mercury,which would take on the gold but not the other impurities.The mixture of mercury and gold would then be recollected and heated until the mercury boiled away.A simple still like those used to make alcohol would draw away the vaporized mercury,possibly collecting it for reuse,leaving mostly pure gold.

2009 8 19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A proprietary gold recovery process has been adopted to quantitatively and selectively recover gold from complex alkaline sulfide solutions containing a mixture of metals such as arsenic,tin,mercury and antimony.This is illustrated by selectively removing gold from an alkaline sulfide leach solution containing these impurities.The assay ofThe Mercury Problem in Artisanal and Small‐Scale Gold.Mercury is frequently used to capture the gold (rather than mercury‐free gravity separation techniques) in cases in which the gold grain is very fine.20d,21 In each trommel,it is common to add between 0.3 and 1 kg of mercury to 20 kg of crushed ore (Figure 2 B).20d The mercury gold amalgam is dense and separates from the finer crushed.
