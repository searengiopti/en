## How Does a Top Load Washer Work? The Spruce
Standard top load washing machines in the United States,Canada,and Australia use a center agitator with propeller like paddles to move clothes through the water from the top of the washer tub to the bottom.The top to bottom agitation continues for the length of the wash cycle forcing water and detergent through the fabrics to loosen any soil.How Portable Centrifugal Oil Cleaning Systems Work.Centrifugal oil cleaners were introduced to help with these problems.They take advantage of a well known force centrifugal force associated with circular motion.Technically speaking,centrifugal force doesn't exist in inertial frames of reference,but in everyday usage,people understand it to be the force directed away from the center.
