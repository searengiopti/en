## Copper Wikipedia
Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29.It is a soft,malleable,and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity.A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish orange color.Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity,as a building material,and as a constituent of various metal alloys,such as sterling.Copper beneficiation processCopper ore divides into ore sulfide,ore oxide and mixing ore according to its oxide rate.The main process for copper ore is flotation,for refractory mixed copper ore and refractory oxide ore,normally use hydrometallurgy process.It is a high technological enterprise that integrated research,manufacture,sales and service.The company has multiple subsidiaries such as Mineral.

## How Is Gold Extracted From Gold Ore? Sciencing
Another process involves ground ore being passed over plates which are coated with mercury The gold and the mercury form an amalgam,leading to the name of the process,amalgamation Once the amalgam has formed,it is heated until the mercury gas is boiled off,leaving the gold The mercury gas is highly toxic and must be handled carefullyExtraction of Copper from Copper pyrite Grade 12 Science.The principal ore of copper is copper pyrite and copper is extracted from this ore.The different steps in extraction of copper are: Crushing and Concentration: The ore obtained from mines are broken down into small piece by jaw crusher and then pulverized.The ore being sulphide ore is concentrated by froth floatation process.
