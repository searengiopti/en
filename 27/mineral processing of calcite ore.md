## Mountain Pass rare earth mine Wikipedia
The Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine is an open pit mine of rare earth elements on the south flank of the Clark Mountain Range,just north of the unincorporated community of Mountain Pass,California,United States.The mine once supplied most of the world's rare earth elements.Owned by MP Materials,it is the only rare earth mining and processing facility in the United States.mineral process of calciteThe Mohs scale of mineral hardness,based on scratch hardness comparison,defines value 3 as "calcite".Other polymorphs of calcium carbonate are the minerals aragonite and vaterite.Aragonite will change to calcite over timescales of days or less at temperatures exceeding 300 °C,and vaterite is.
