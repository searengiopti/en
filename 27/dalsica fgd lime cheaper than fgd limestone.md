Limestone being cheaper and more abundant than other alkalis is the most commonly used reagent for the process.In wet FGD systems,the alkali and flue gas are brought into contact in a spray tower where the alkali reacts with the SO2 in the flue gas to produce a mixture of sulphite and sulphate salts.Medina's Vexor Technology turns trash into fuelbased Carmeuse Group,an international lime and limestone company that uses the fuel in its U.S.lime kilns.Vexor began producing the fuel in 2010 at a 60,000 square foot facility at its Medina plant,which for more than 20 years has been handling other types of industrial and specialty waste as well.

## Flue gas desulfurization
Flue gas desulfurization (FGD) is the current state of the art technology used for removing sulfur dioxide (SO 2) from the exhaust flue gases in power plants that burn coal or oil to produce steam for the steam turbines that drive their electricity generators.Sulfur dioxide is responsible for acid.Comparing materials used in mist eliminators (Journal.A system for evaluating Chevron type mist eliminators used with FGD lime or limestone scrubbers includes spiral type nozzles for generating water mist and a heated,fan driven damper controlled airflow directed into a duct representing the absorber section of the scrubber.
