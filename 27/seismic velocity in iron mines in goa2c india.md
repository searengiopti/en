Goa is a small state situated at the western ghats of India,with a large number of Iron ore mines,where Ripper dozers are used for excavation.Ophiolite WikipediaScientists have drilled only about 1.5 km into the 6 to 7 kilometer thick oceanic crust,so their understanding of oceanic crust comes largely from comparing ophiolite structure to seismic soundings of in situ oceanic crust.Oceanic crust has a layered velocity structure that implies a layered rock series similar to that listed above.

The Sidoarjo mud flow or Lapindo mud (informally abbreviated as Lusi,a contraction of Lumpur Sidoarjo wherein lumpur is the Indonesian word for mud) is the result of an erupting mud volcano in the subdistrict of Porong,Sidoarjo in East Java,Indonesia that has been in eruption since May 2006.The excavation disturbed zone (EDZ) at Kiirunavaara mine.For LKAB's Kiirunavaara underground iron ore mine in Sweden,the understanding of the EDZ is essential for optimal design of rock support.With this main objective an EDZ investigation was conducted at the mine using seismic measurement techniques.Cross hole seismics and spectral analyses of surfaces waves (SASW) were the main techniques used.
