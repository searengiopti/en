## How iron is made
Today,steel production makes use of recycled materials as well as traditional raw materials,such as iron ore,coal,and limestone.Two processes,basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) and electric arc furnaces (EAF),account for virtually all steel production.Extraction of Iron (examples,answers,activities.Extraction of iron Very unreactive metals are found directly in the ground as elements,eg.gold.Most metals are found in ores where they have reacted with other elements.Ores are rocks containing enough metal to make it economical to extract.We can extract the iron by reacting the iron oxide with a more reactive element.

World Coal AssociationHow is Steel Produced? Global steel production is dependent on coal.70% of the steel produced uses coal.Metallurgical coal or coking coal is a vital ingredient in the steel making process.World crude steel production was 1.8 billion tonnes in 2018.

## Extraction Process of Aluminium from Bauxite Ore
Alumina Extraction Problem.In the standard Bayer Process for refining bauxite to produce alumina,the dissolution of the alumina in the ore to form sodium aluminate is accomplished in autoclaves under high pressures varying from 70 to 200 pounds per square inch.The Blast Furnace S cool,the revision websiteThe method.Three substances are needed to enable to extraction of iron from its ore.The combined mixture is called the charge:.Iron ore,haematite often contains sand with iron oxide,Fe 2 O 3.Limestone (calcium carbonate).Coke mainly carbon.The charge is placed a giant chimney called a blast furnace.The blast furnace is around 30 metres high and lined with fireproof bricks.
