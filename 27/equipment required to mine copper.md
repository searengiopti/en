## Electrolytic Copper Refining Plant metal
Electrolysis of copper transfers copper atoms from an impure copper anode to a pure copper cathode,leaving the impurities behind.A series of equipment are installed in the plant.Next,Whirlston Metal Recycling Machinery will detail more information on the cost effective setup.Mining Methods and Equipment2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The majority of open pit mines in Australia currently operate using discontinuous shovel truck systems.These systems are favoured as they enable; (i) mining capacity to be progressively scaled up over the life of a mine; (ii) the use of narrow benches that defer the high costs of stripping,and (iii) flexibility to rapidly adapt mine plans in the face of uncertainties caused by changing.
