## Environmental impact of iron ore mining Wikipedia
Roughly 98% of iron ore on the global market is used in iron and steel production.Mining and processing.Common methods of extracting the iron ore consist of blasting,drilling,or general excavating.Most iron ore is produced from open pit mines.After the iron ore is out of the ground,it may be shipped to the iron and steel manufacturing.iron ore processing plant in australiairon ore processing plant in australia.Our iron ore wet processing plants are proven to successfully deal with silica and alumina contamination in the iron ore resulting in an increase in the Fe value of the iron ore.
