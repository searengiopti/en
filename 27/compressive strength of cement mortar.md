## Concrete masonry unit Wikipedia
The compressive strength of concrete masonry units and masonry walls varies from approximately 1,000 psi (7 MPa) to 5,000 psi (34 MPa) based on the type of concrete used to manufacture the unit,stacking orientation,the type of mortar used to build the wall,and other factors.How to Choose the Right Mortar Mix: N,O,S,or MType N mortar mix has a medium compressive strength and it is composed of 1 part Portland cement,1 part lime,and 6 parts sand.It is considered to be a general purpose mix,useful for above grade,exterior,and interior load bearing installations.It is also the preferred mortar mix for soft stone masonry.

## Tests to Check the Compressive Strength of Cement
Basically,because of strength,nature of cement,both mortar and concrete are very strong in compression and weak in tension,hence testing of cement for compressive strength is most important because it is the major purpose for which it is used.So that it is essential to know about the compressive strength of cement and it is the most.Mortar an overview ScienceDirect TopicsIts compressive strength is decided by the mean value of the compressive strength of a group (6 pieces) of standard test samples after being cured for 28 days.Mortar has six strength levels such as M2.5,M5.0,M7.5,MIO,M15 and M20.To a water absorbing substrate,mortar strength mainly depends on the strength and amount of its cement content.
