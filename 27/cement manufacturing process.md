## How Cement Is Made
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.The cement is now ready for transport to ready mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects.Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement,some kilns in the United States use a wet process.Cement Manufacturing Process Phases Flow Chart CementAug 30,2012&nbsp&#0183&#32Cement Manufacturing Process Phase IV: Kiln Phase.Kiln is a huge rotating furnace also called as the heart of cement making process.Here,raw material is heated up to 1450 ⁰C.This temperature begins a chemical reaction so called decarbonation.In this reaction material (like limestone) releases the carbon dioxide.
