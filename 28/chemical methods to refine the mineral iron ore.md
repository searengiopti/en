## How iron is made
For centuries the Europeans lacked methods for heating iron to the melting point at all.To produce iron,they slowly burned iron ore with wood in a clay lined oven.The iron separated from the surrounding rock but never quite melted.Instead,it formed a crusty slag which was removed by hammering.Mineral processing WikipediaOct 25,2018 · The first step in almost all gold refining is physical,while the last steps are always chemical.Modern gold mines take huge piles of rock and process them in order to extract a few grams per tonne.It's really hard to imagine how much rock needs.

The ore body is too deep to mine profitably by open pit.The grades or quality of the orebody are high enough to cover costs.Underground mining has a lower ground footprint than open pit mining.The underground mining methods we use include room and pillar,narrow vein stoping and large scale mechanised mining.Iron Ore Smelting Process Bright Hub EngineeringIron ore is obtained in the conventional method of open cast or underground mining and conveying the ore to the surface preparation are where it is crushed,washed,and transported to the smelter.Here the ore is put into a blast furnace along with limestone and coke and subjected to hot air blasting and heat which converts the ore to molten iron.

## Chemical risks in mining industry
2020 2 24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The production of minerals involves a series of physical and chemical processes.These may occur at any time from excavation of the ore that contains the metal in mineral form through production of the metal in marketable form.Methods for physically separating the ore from surrounding material also include complex processes,such as leaching mixing the ore with chemical solutions or other.Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores.Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? Reference.com
Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining.The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.How iron is made material,manufacture,making,history.Features Library consists of a complete list of the various mining industries that MiningWeekly.com cover,such as coal,diamonds,iron ore,besides others,as well as Corporate Profiles and Top.

## Processes extraction,mining,smelting,refining.
An ore is a rock containing enough valuable mineral to make it worth extracting.In the case of copper,it is worth extracting when there is about 2 kg of copper per 1,000 kg of ore (0.2%).Copper minerals are found in over one hundred varieties,although only a few have been worked for copper on a large scale.Mining and Refining Aluminum HowStuffWorksThe primary s­ource of aluminum is an ore known as bauxite.An ore is any naturally occurring solid m­aterial from which a metal or valuable mineral can be obtained.In this case,the solid material is a mixture of hydrated aluminum oxide and hydrated iron oxide.

## The Extraction of Iron
Extracting iron from iron ore using a Blast Furnace.The common ores of iron are both iron oxides,and these can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke.Coke is produced by heating coal in the absence of air.Coke is cheap and provides both the reducing agent for the reaction and also the heat source.Electrolytic Refining Mineral Processing & MetallurgyThe list of pure non ferrous metals so widely used in modern industry includes many that are produced by electrolytic means,such as copper,zinc,nickel,aluminum,magnesium,lead,sodium,cadmium,calcium and many others.In the case of some metals,ordinary fire or chemical methods of production are important,but in others,100 per cent of.
