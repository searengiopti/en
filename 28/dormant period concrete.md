## Why Concrete Temperature is Important,Especially During
This is the period at which the fresh concrete is being transported and placed since it has not yet hardened and is still workable (plastic and fluid).The length of the dormant period has been shown to vary depending on multiple factors (cement type,admixtures,w cm).The end of the dormant period is typically characterised by the initial set.Early Shrinkage Development in a High Performance ConcreteAs autogenous shrinkage in low water binder concrete starts to develop almost as soon as portland cement hydrates it is very important to start shrinkage measurement.
