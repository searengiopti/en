## Faculty of Engineering Technology
The belt conveyor that moves the potatoes towards the bunker is called the sorting table.Along this table people can stand and pick the last soil and foliage from the product.The end piece of the table can make an angle if the bunker is getting full.On this belt.Designing Inclined Screw Conveyors for Industrial.The purpose of a screw conveyor is to transfer product from one point to the next.Screw conveyors are always control fed at the inlet by another conveyor or metering device.Rotary valves,screw feeders,belt conveyors,grinders,or even other screw conveyors typically are connected to the inlet of a screw conveyor.
