## Mill (grinding) Wikipedia
A VSI mill throws rock or ore particles against a wear plate by slinging them from a spinning center that rotates on a vertical shaft.This type of mill uses the same principle as a VSI crusher.Tower mill.Tower mills,often called vertical mills,stirred mills or regrind mills,are a more efficient means of grinding material at smaller particle sizes,and can be used after ball mills in a.Grinding Media Balls for Mines and Minerals Processing.There is no standard solution for mineral industry and wear rate of grinding media varies from mine to mine,ore to ore and even for the same ore time to time.Different alloys are recommended depending on ore type and mill particulars in order to arrive at the most cost economic solution.
