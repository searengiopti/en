## Magnetic Separators
Magnetic Separators Douglas magnetic separators are for use in helping to separate tramp ferrous metals from conveyed material.Most commonly they are suspended above and across the belt pulling metal up and away from the product flow.Magnetic Separation Method Mineral Processing & MetallurgyMagnetic separation is a process used to separate materials from those that are less or non­magnetic.All materials have a response when placed in a magnetic field,although with most,the effect is too slight to be detected.The few materials that are strongly affected (magnetised) by magnetic fields are known as “Ferromagnetics”,those lesser (though noticeably) affected are known as.
