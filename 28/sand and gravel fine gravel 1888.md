Or fine gravel? Yahoo AnswersMay 01,2008&nbsp&#0183&#32Best Answer: I use sand as my substrate in both my Brackish and Freshwater When using a &quotGravel Vac&quot.this is what I do.I submerge and get it to siphon as normal.I never plunge or place it IN the sand,I simply hold it about two inches above the sand and just that stirs it up just enough to get things up off the surface.
