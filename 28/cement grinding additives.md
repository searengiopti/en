## US8758504B2 Dilution stable cement grinding additive.
The present invention provides cement grinding additive compositions and methods which allow a powerful,robust defoamer to be uniformly dispersed throughout a broad concentration range while retaining storage stability even in cases wherein the defoamer is highly diluted.Exemplary cement grinding additive compositions comprise at least one amine cement grinding additive.The Optimization of Calcareous Fly Ash Added Cement.Affecting the early age strength,additive E offers a 2 day compressive strength similar to that of the reference cement.Additives Ö1 and N offer similar 2 day compressive strength patterns.Additive Ö2,a grinding aid,was found to have negligible effect on the strength (for early ages).
