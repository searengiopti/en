Gold Cyanide Solution (Leaching Gold With Cyanide) Since the 1890's,cyanide has been used to recover gold from gold bearing ores.And today,over 115 years later,most of the worlds gold is recovered with cyanide playing a large part in the beneficiation of the yellow precious metal.Introduction to Mineral Processing cpchemGold,silver,copper,lead,zinc,molybdenum,iron,potash,phosphate,and even sand for glass are often processed by froth flotation.Without froth flotation,many of the metals and minerals used every day in our modern world would be much more expensive.Solvent Extraction Solvent extraction is a hydrometallurgical process.The process entails:
