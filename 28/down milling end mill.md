## End mill Wikipedia
An end mill is a type of milling cutter,a cutting tool used in industrial milling applications.It is distinguished from the drill bit in its application,geometry,and manufacture.While a drill bit can only cut in the axial direction,most milling bits can cut in the radial direction.Not all mills can cut axially; those designed to cut axially are known as end mills.Ceramic End Mills MITSUBISHI MATERIALS CORPORATIONCeramic End Mills.Cutting Conditions.Requires High Cutting Speeds (From 350m min to 1000m min).Down cut climb milling is highly recommended.Up cutting can be unstable.Others.Tool Holder Recommendation Hydraulic Chuck.First recommendation for tool holding is a hydraulic chuck,second recommendation is a precision milling.
