SciencingGold is usually found alone or alloyed with mercury or silver,but can also be found in ores such as calaverite,sylvanite,nagyagite,petzite and krennerite.Most gold ore now comes from either open pit or underground mines.The ores sometimes contain as little as 5 100 of an ounce of gold.

## aluminum processing History,Mining,Refining,& Facts.
Aluminum,or aluminium (Al),is a silvery white metal with a melting point of 660 °C (1,220 °F) and a density of 2.7 grams per cubic cm.The most abundant metallic element,it constitutes 8.1 percent of Earth's crust.In nature it occurs chemically combined with oxygen and other elements.In the pure state it is soft and ductile,but it can.What Is Alum and How Is It Used? ThoughtCoJul 11,2019 · Chrome Alum: Chrome alum or chromium alum has the formula KCr(S O 4) 2 ·12H 2 O.This deep violet compound is used in tanning and can be added to other alum to grow lavender or purple crystals.Selenate Alums: Selenate alums occur when selenium takes the place of sulfur so that instead of a sulfate you get a selenate,(SeO 4 2 ).The selenium.
