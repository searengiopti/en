Procedures for Metal Extraction.Concentration of Ores: Ores may be concentrated either by (i) Washing away the earthy materials in a stream of water in order to leave behind the heavier ores as is the case with tin ore or by (ii) Froth flotation where the ores are churned up with oil and water to form froth.This froth which contains the ore is skimmed off by blowing air.Lead Essential Chemical IndustryThe process is carried out in a series of tanks.As the lead and zinc minerals are less readily wetted than the gangue,they adhere to the air bubbles which are carried to the surface.The rock particles sink and the lead and zinc ores are skimmed off.Then the lead ore is separated from the zinc ore.

## Zinc: smelting,producing and classification Metalpedia
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.The most common zinc concentrate processed is zinc sulfide,which is obtained by concentrating sphalerite using the froth flotation method.There are two methods of smelting zinc: the pyrometallurgical process and the hydrometallurgical process (over 90% of hydrometallurgical process is in.Reduction of Metals (Extraction from Ore) A Level ChemistryThere are 3 main methods of extracting metals from their ore.They are reduction of the ore with carbon,reduction of the molten ore by electrolysis,and reduction of the ore with a more reactive metal.Metals such as zinc,iron and copper are present in ores as their oxides.Each of these oxides is heated with carbon to obtain the metal.
