The pressure is usually confined internally with steel bands,although this may also be accomplished with hydraulic pressure.Belt presses were the first technique for creating diamonds,and they are still in use today,although modern belt presses are now much larger than the original design.Practical Considerations in the Hydro ReMining of GoldHydraulic remining is generally best suited to reclamation of hydraulically deposited tailings and fine sands.Coarser residues are better remined by mechanical means.Mechanical reclamation is an expensive option for finer tailings,and dredging is generally more expensive than hydraulic remining,especially where labor rates are low.

## Hydraulic pump switching to stand by in gold mine elevator.
 · A gold mine has an elevator that travels approximately 4000 ft down a deep shaft.The shaft is a vertical excavation adjacent to the mine’s gold ore body.Shaft haulage is more economical than truck haulage at this depth.The ore from the mine is dumped down an ore pass (a vertical excavation),where it falls to a collection level.Gold processing BritannicaGold processing,preparation of the ore for use in various products.For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value.These images are derived from two properties of gold,its colour and its chemical stability.The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom,which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms.

## Hydraulic Mining.Historic Gold Mining Methods of California
Hydraulic Mining was a gold recovery method that was used during many of the gold rushes around the world during the 1800’s.It was used extensively in California's Mother Lode county during the famous gold rush there.One of the problems that the early California gold miners faced with basic placer mining was the amount of manual labor that was required to process the gravels.What Were Some of the Tools That Were Used in the Gold.Riverbeds in remote mountains contained gold bearing gravel.Hydraulic mining was used to extract this gold from water and gravel.Gigantic floating dredges scooped up the river gravel while hydraulic cannons blasted hillsides and washed them into the streams and rivers.The first hydraulic cannon was invented by Edward Mattison in 1853.
