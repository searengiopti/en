## Froth flotation circuit design and basic testwork.
Froth flotation is a very important mineral concentration process that is used to recover a vast array of different minerals containing valuable commodities such as copper,lead,zinc,nickel,molybdenum,tungsten,silver,gold,phosphate and potash.In the flotation process,ore is ground to a size sufficient to adequately liberate desired.Froth Flotation Method2020 2 26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The froth flotation method is widely used to treat various veins of gold and silver ores for the following reasons: (1) In most cases,the froth flotation process can enrich gold and silver in sulfide concentrate to the greatest extent and discard a large number of tailings,thus reducing the smelting cost.
