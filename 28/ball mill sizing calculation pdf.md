## The effect of ball size on mill performance
The specific rates of breakage of particles in a tumbling ball mill are described by the equation S i = ax Œ± i (Q(z),where Q(z) is the probability function which ranges from 1 to 0 as particle size increases.This equation produces a maximum in S,and the particle size of the maximum is related to ball diameter by x m = k 1 d 2.The variation of a with ball diameter was found to be of the form.A Method to Determine the Ball Filling,in Miduk Copper,balls which exist in mill,ùê¥ùëè: each ball abrasion (g),ùê¥t: total ball abrasion in the mill (g),ùë£b: each ball volume (m3),ùëìb: supposed ball filling percentage,A r: ball abrasion rate in the mill If above calculation were done again for ùëìb = 2%,total ball abrasion will get 6096,finally

## Design,Construction and Performance Analysis of a 5.
The laboratory ball mill was designed for grinding limestone,meaning that the work index required for the specific power calculation was assumed to be the work index of limestone,which is 11.6 KWh t,with a specific gravity of 2.6 g cm.3.or 2600 kg m.3.The feed size (F.80) of the ball mill was assumed to be 2 mm (2000 microns).AMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills & Circuits Mining Mill,Number,size and mass of each ball size depends on mill load and whether or not the media is being added as the initial charge For the initial chargin of a mill,Coghill and DeVaney (1937) defined the ball size as a function of the top size of the feed,ie,d√¢‚Ä†‚ÄúV = 040 K√¢ÀÜ≈°F dB = ball size (cm) F = feed size (cm)
