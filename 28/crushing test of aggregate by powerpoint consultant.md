## Aggregates Technician
Aggregate Technician : This process is designed to certify technicians to properly sample and test highway construction aggregates.Quality Control Technicians acquiring this certification work at typical crushed stone quarries ('C' sources on QPL 2),certain temporary sources ('T' sources on QPL 2),or certain vending yards ('V' sources on QPL 2).Aggregate Crushing Value Test Determine Aggregate.Concept and significance of the Aggregate crushing value test.The ‘ aggregate crushing value test ` gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load.Aggregate crushing value is defined as the percentage by weight of the crushed (or finer) material obtained when the test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under.

## Section III: Surface Gravel
aggregate is obtaining a good sample of the material to be tested.Knowing how to get a good representative sample from a crushing operation,a stockpile,a windrow,or a paving operation is absolutely critical to getting good test results from a lab.Poor sampling techniques have led to more controversy in aggregate testing than any other factor.Aggregate Crushing Value TestAggregate crushing value test on coarse aggregates gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate crushing under gradually applied compressive load.Coarse aggregate crushing value is the percentage by weight of the crushed material obtained when test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions.
