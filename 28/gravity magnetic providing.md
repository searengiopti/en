## How Can We Create Artificial Gravity? » Science ABC
May 10,2016 · Nevertheless,constant linear acceleration is desirable,since in addition to providing artificial gravity,it could theoretically provide relatively short flight times around the solar system.Magnetism: There is a method by which the effects of gravity can be created using dia magnetism,but it requires extremely powerful magnetic fields.Magnetic Field And Gravity Intimately Linked PlanetSave2020115&ensp&#0183&enspShortterm changes in the Earth's magnetic field that occur over periods of just years or decades have now been shown in new research to have a very close relationship with changes in gravity.The research focused on a specific area,stretching from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean.In this area,changes in the magnetic field correlate very closely with variations in gravity.
