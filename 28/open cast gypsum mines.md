## Openpit mining Wikipedia
Openpit mining is to be considered one of the most dangerous sectors in the industrial world.It causes significant effects to miners health,as well as damage to the ecological land.Openpit mining causes changes to vegetation,soil,and bedrock,which ultimately contributes to changes in surface hydrology,groundwater levels,and flow paths.Calcium sulfate WikipediaThe main sources of calcium sulfate are naturally occurring gypsum and anhydrite,which occur at many locations worldwide as evaporites.These may be extracted by open cast quarrying or by deep mining.World production of natural gypsum is around 127 million tonnes per annum.
