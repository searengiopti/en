2020124&ensp&#0183&enspUse the table or equation to determine the pitch,lead,and lead angle of the multistart thread.Use a single form thread mill to helically interpolate the first thread at the correct lead.*The thread mill used must have a relief angle greater than that of the multistart thread's lead angle in order to machine the thread.Ball screw preload: What you need to know Linear MotionHigher preload also correlates with higher nut rigidity,which improves the rigidity of the complete screw assembly.But because the ball nut is only one component in the ball screw assembly,and its rigidity is relatively high compared to the other components,increasing the preload — from 3 percent to 5 percent,for example — has a minimal effect on the rigidity of the assembly.

We'd like to guarantee zero backlash,but this would be unreasonable.How to set Steps Per Unit values?
