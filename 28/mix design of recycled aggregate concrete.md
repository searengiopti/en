## Concrete Mix Design Procedure and Example IS456
Concrete mix design is the process of finding the proportions of concrete mix in terms of ratios of cement,sand and coarse aggregat For eg,a concrete mix of proportions 1:2:4 means that cement,fine and coarse aggregate are in the ratio 1:2:4 or the mix contains one part of cement,two parts of fine aggregate and four parts of coarse aggregateRecycled Aggregate Concrete SpringerLinkThe main objective of mix proportion design is to determine the most economic recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) ingredients,even for natural aggregate concrete (NAC) Furthermore,a reasonable mix proportion design also assures the safety of structur
