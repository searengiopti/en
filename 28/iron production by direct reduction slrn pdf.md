A method for producing iron carbide for use as an iron source in steelmaking is provided.The method can use a wide range of feedstocks without depending on natural gas by using other forms of carbon as the carburizing source.The present method accomplishes the production of iron carbide by mixing together finely divided iron oxide containing feedstocks and carbon,pelletizing the mixture.Sponge Iron Production By Direct Reduction Of Iron Oxide.This book provides a fascinating study of the very important emerging field of direct reduction in which iron ore is 'directly reduced' in the solid state,using either natural gas or non coking coal,to produce a highly metallised material,referred to as sponge iron (or direct reduced iron).This intermediate product is subsequently melted in electric arc furnaces or induction furnaces.
