Sulfur:limestone autotrophic denitrification processes for treatment of nitrate contaminated water: batch experiments.Nitrate nitrogen removal increased with the addition of granular sulfur and limestone,while the addition of a seed of autotrophic denitrifiers into the batch reactors accelerated nitrate removal.Based on these.Rock Experiments Home Science ToolsThese 3 rock experiments show what happens when they freeze,absorb water,and how chemicals can erode or dissolve them.Put the limestone in a bowl,pour a little vinegar on top of it and watch what happens.It will fizz and form bubbles,because the vinegar reacts with the carbonate ions.There is also a Rock Cycle science project.
