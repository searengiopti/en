## Cobalt extraction Wikipedia
Recovery from copper cobalt sulfide concentrates.The ores are treated by a sulfatizing roast in a fluidized bed furnace to convert copper and cobalt sulfides into soluble sulfates and iron into insoluble hematite.The calcine is subsequently leached with sulfuric acid from the spent copper recovery electrolyte.Oxide concentrates are introduced at this leaching step to maintain the acid balance.Copper Mining and Extraction Sulfide OresThe smelter for sulfide ores produces sulfur dioxide gas.This is scrubbed from the flue gases to make sulfuric acid for leaching copper from oxide ores.Scrubbing sulfur dioxide also protects the environment.For example: FeO(s) + SiO 2 (s)→ FeO.SiO 2 (slag) This is very similar to the removal of impurities in the blast furnace.
