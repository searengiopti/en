## ORB: Iron and Steel Production in the Middle Ages
Both wrought iron and cast iron have their uses,but since neither form of iron has ideal properties,the smith will probably want to make steel,at least in small amounts.To do this,he needs another type of furnace.If he is faced with high carbon cast iron,he must use an oxygen rich furnace to try to "decarburize" or reduce the carbon content.Steel WikipediaSteel is an alloy of iron and carbon and other elements.Because of its high tensile strength and low cost,it is a major component used in buildings,infrastructure,tools,ships,automobiles,machines,appliances,and weapons.
