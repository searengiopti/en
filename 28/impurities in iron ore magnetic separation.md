impurities in iron ore magnetic separation.Iron ore.Iron ores are rocks and minerals from it separates Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 from other impurities in the iron ore.Which of the following ores cannot be concentrated toppr.comNov 22,2019 · Magnetic separation based on differences in magnetic properties of the ore components.If either the ore or the gangue is attracted towards the magnetic field,then the separation is carried out by this method.For example,iron ores are attracted towards the magnet,hence,non magnetic impurities can be separated from them using magnetic separation.
