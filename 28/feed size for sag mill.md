## Understanding Size Effects of Semi autogenous Grinding.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;&quot;Although it is well known and easily experienced that the feed size distribution influences the throughput and stability of operation of a semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill,the details are poorly understood since it is often only the input and output measurements that are used to identify unfavourable in mill conditions.Com 12 Primary SAG Mill Grind Control Final Blue Cube SystemsOptimization and Control of a Primary SAG Mill Using Real time Grind.the primary mill product in an attempt to control and possibly reduce flotation feed size.

## Design SAG mill production when you need it most: In day 1
Feed Size,F80: Primary crushed ore is mandatory to feed any SAG mill.Typical feed size range is 80% passing 130 to 160 mm.Softer ores will be a little finer but the finer size is not sustainable when the ore becomes hard.Precrushing to finer sizes enhances throughput as does crushing of pebbles from the SAG mill (usually minus 60 mm).Mill (grinding) WikipediaSAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor.
