By using ore sorting equipment,ore concentrates can be created at very low cost in small or remote mining installations.The entire processing line can be planned in semi mobile form and consists only of crushers,screens,belts and sorting machines.This allows immense cost savings for transport,since the waste rock is disposed of on site.Lecture 4: Mining wasteWaste rock is the rock that is excavated to reach the ore.The amount of waste rock that needs to be removed depends on the geometry and location of the ore body,along with the mining method used and the composition and stability of the rocks.The ratio between waste rock and ore production is called the stripping ratio.
