## Do the Benefits of Recycling Outweigh the Costs?
Environmental groups were quick to dispute Tierney on the benefits of recycling,especially on assertions that recycling was doubling energy consumption and pollution while costing taxpayers more money than disposing of plain old garbage.The Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense,two of the nation’s most influential environmental organizations,each issued reports.Getting started: Setting up an injection molding plant.Two decades ago,a 30 million custom molding company was considered a top business.Today,as a result of mergers,acquisitions,and growth that has outpaced the national average,a company that size is considered small.So although an individual can set up a small injection molding operation for less than 1 million,unless the company has a special capability to offer or establishes a sound.

## Mining Water for all
Mining produces mainly tailings (the waste materials left after the valuable ore is separated out) and overburden (the waste materials removed to reach the ore).During the mining process,water within and around the mine is usually contaminated,so treating the mine water before it is discharged back into the environment is a major issue [2].Oil tanker2020 2 14&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;An oil tanker,also known as a petroleum tanker,is a ship designed for the bulk transport of oil or its products.There are two basic types of oil tankers: crude tankers and product tankers.Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries.For example,moving crude oil from oil wells in a producing country to refineries in another country.
