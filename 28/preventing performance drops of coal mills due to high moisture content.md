## boiler trips due to coal mills tripping
The particle size distribution of raw fly ash tends to fluctuate constantly,due to changing performance of the coal mills and the boiler performance This makes it necessary that,if fly ash is used in an optimal way to replace cement in concrete production,it must be processed using beneficiation methods like mechanical air classificationInoculant strategies for corn silage,high moisture corn.Spoilage yeasts are especially prevalent in feeds rich in starch,such as corn silage,high moisture corn (HMC) and snaplage.The main differences between corn silage,HMC and snaplage are the DM at harvest and the origin of the feed: Corn silage,made from the entire corn plant,is typically ensiled at a DM content of 32 to 35 percent.
