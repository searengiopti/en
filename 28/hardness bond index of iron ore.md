## Mohs scale of mineral hardness Wikipedia
The Mohs scale of mineral hardness ( m oʊ z ) is a qualitative ordinal scale characterizing scratch resistance of various minerals through the ability of harder material to scratch softer material.Created in 1812 by German geologist and mineralogist Friedrich Mohs,it is one of several definitions of hardness in materials science,some of which are more quantitative.(PDF) A quick method for bond work index approximate value.The Bond work index is a measure of ore resistance to crushing and grinding and is determined using the Bond grindability test.Its value constitutes ore characteristic and is used for industrial.
