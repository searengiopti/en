## Optimization of mill performance by using
Mill power Usually,plant operators use mill power readings as an indicator of ball filling degree and,often,try to keep it at the maximum level.It is well known that the mill absorbed power depends on operating parameters other than ball level,such as pulp density and liner configuration.Figure 2 shows that there is no linear relation betweenSelecting Inching Drives for Mill and Kiln Applicationsmain power is lost for the rotation of the kiln.The second cement application for inching drives is the rotation of the horizontal grinding mills for maintenance.Here the inching drive provides positional accuracy and holding capabilities for mill shell liner replacement and other operations.The inching drive components include a prime
