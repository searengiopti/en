## Gold mrchrisblake
For example,it is often desirable to remove coarse liberated grains of gold using gravity techniques prior to flotation as these high density grains often report to the tailings due to the flotation cell kinetics.Similarly,excess milling of coarse gold may result in the smearing of the gold within the mill and subsequent losses.Introduction to Mineral Processing Chevron Phillips ChemicalThe process of froth flotation entails crushing and grinding the ore to a fine size.This fine grinding separates the individual mineral particles from the waste rock and other mineral particles.The grinding is normally done in water with the resultant slurry called the pulp.The pulp is processed in the flotation cells,which agitate the.

## 1 Froth Flotation Fundamental Principles
no flotation can occur.Contact between particles and bubbles can be accomplished in a flotation cell such as the one shown schematically in Figure 5.Figure 5: Simplified schematic of a conventional flotation cell.The rotor draws slurry through the stator and expels it to the sides,creating a suction that draws air down the shaft of the stator.Froth flotation WikipediaFroth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing,paper recycling and waste water treatment industries.Historically this was first used in the mining industry,where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.
