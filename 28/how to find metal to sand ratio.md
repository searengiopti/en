First add some water (roughly a gallon to start off) and figure out how much of each material to add using a 3 to 1 ratio of sand (3) and cement (1).Remember that sand will weigh a lot more than cement and a good trick would be to weigh half of a five gallon bucket of sand.Concrete Mix Ratios Cement,Sand,Aggregate and WaterConcrete mix ratio of 1:3:3 On mixing 1 part cement,3 parts sand with 3 parts aggregate produces concrete with a compressive strength of 3000 psi On mixing water with the three ingredients,a paste is formed that binds them together till the concrete mix gets hardened The strength concrete is inversely proportional to the water cement.
