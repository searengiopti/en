## How Are Diamonds Mined And Extracted From the Ground
Because marine deposits are distributed over large areas unevenly,mining companies utilize different methods to mine them.Some of these methods include shallow water mining,deep sea operations involving high tech equipment and simple alluvial mining.Like open pit mining,the ore materials are usually transported offsite for further processing.Frontiers Data Mining Techniques in Analyzing …Due to increasing use of technology enhanced educational assessment,data mining methods have been explored to analyse process data in log files from such assessment.However,most studies were limited to one data mining technique under one specific scenario.The current study demonstrates the usage of four frequently used supervised techniques,including Classification and Regression Trees.
