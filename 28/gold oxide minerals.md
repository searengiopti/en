## Sulfide mineral Wikipedia
The sulfide minerals are a class of minerals containing sulfide (S 2−) or persulfide (S 2 2−) as the major anion.Some sulfide minerals are economically important as metal ores.The sulfide class also includes the selenides,the tellurides,the arsenides,the antimonides,the bismuthinides,the sulfarsenides and the sulfosalts.Sulfide minerals are inorganic compoundsPOLYMETALLIC VEIN AND REPLACEMENT DEPOSITS …2004 2 18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;iron oxide minerals (limonite),cerargyrite,and jarosite,tend to be relatively insoluble and indicative of deposition from relatively high pH water.Igneous ore—native gold,cerargyrite,and iron oxide minerals.Minerals formed by recent weathering after the onset of mining: These minerals are primarily soluble sulf ate minerals

## Gold extraction Wikipedia
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery of.List Minerals Associated with GoldTo know what type of rock is gold associated with you must see that the minerals most common in placer deposits are platinum,iridosmine,magnetite,iron pyrites,ilmenite,zircon,garnets,rutile and barytes; wolfram,scheelite,brookite and diamonds are less common.Diamonds are associated with gold in Brazil,and also occasionally in the Urals and in the United States.In auriferous quartz.

## Roasting (metallurgy) Wikipedia
In roasting,the ore or ore concentrate is treated with very hot air.This process is generally applied to sulfide minerals.During roasting,the sulfide is converted to an oxide,and sulfur is released as sulfur dioxide,a gas.For the ores Cu 2 S and ZnS,balanced equations for the roasting are:sulfide mineral Definition,Examples,Identification.The composition of the sulfide minerals can be expressed with the general chemical formula A m S n,in which A is a metal,S is sulfur,and m and n are integers,giving A 2 S,AS,A 3 S 4 and AS 2 stoichiometries.The metals that occur most commonly in sulfides are iron,copper,nickel,lead,cobalt,silver,and zinc,though about fifteen others enter sulfide structures.

## Oxide mineral Britannica
The oxide minerals can be grouped as simple oxides and multiple oxides.Simple oxides are a combination of one metal or semimetal and oxygen,whereas multiple oxides have two nonequivalent metal sites.The oxide structures are usually based on cubic or hexagonal close packing of oxygen atoms with the octahedral or tetrahedral sites (or both) occupied by metal ions; symmetry is typically.Mineral Cleaning for Amateurs John Betts Fine MineralsFirst wash your minerals carefully in water to remove any loose sand and dirt and to make the acid last as long as possible (sand and dirt contain iron oxide and will exhaust your acid quickly).Place your minerals in a large plastic container with a lid that can be tightly sealed.
