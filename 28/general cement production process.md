•Cement industry thinks CCS is relevant,they are aware of R&D but there is low willingness to contribute to pilot demonstration plants •Most cement production is in developing countries •Impact on competitiveness and under developed legal frameworks are barriers to use of CCSCement Production and Manufacturing Process …Cement Production Process and Reactions.Each step of cement manufacturing,physical conditions and reactions occurred are explained here.Raw material transportation.Limestone is carried to the plant from mining place usually by a train.Some cement plants import clinker from other country or plant and add gypsum to produce cement.

## A Review On Environmental and Health Impacts Of Cement.
2.Cement Manufacturing Process: The main component of cement is clinker,which is produced from raw materials,such as limestone and clay.[8].Limestone supplies CaCO 3 for the cement production.Silica,alumina,and iron are considered to be other raw materials.The lime stone used for cement manufacturing contains 75 90 % of CaCo 3How sand is made material,manufacture,making,history.The production of sand for construction purposes grew significantly with the push for paved roads during World War I and through the 1920s.The housing boom of the late 1940s and early 1950s,coupled with the increased use of concrete for building construction,provided another boost in production.
