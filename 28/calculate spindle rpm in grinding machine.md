N = machine speed in revolutions minute (RPM).This follows since most (manual) lathes cannot increase spindle speed (N) during cutting operations.Thus&nbsp;.Understanding CNC Torque vs HorsepowerNewer,high speed machining centers hold constant torque.We like Constant Torque Because of the unique geometry,our tools perform best under constant torque.Take a look at the torque curve for your CNC machine.If you have a 10,000 RPM spindle motor and the torque drops from it’s constant peak at 8200 RPM,then 8200 RPM would be the.

## Speeds and feeds Wikipedia
The phrase speeds and feeds or feeds and speeds refers to two separate velocities in machine tool practice,cutting speed and feed rate.They are often considered as a pair because of their combined effect on the cutting process.Each,however,can also be considered and analyzed in its own right.Machining CalculatorsMachining Calculators Cutting Speed and Spindle Speed Machining Calculators should be used to calculate what speeds you should be machining your parts at,by taking the material,tool and tool material into account.correctly setting up your tooling and material allows you to maximise machining quality,as well as product quality.
