## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Aug 22,2018 · Strip mining destroys landscapes,forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees,plants,and topsoil are cleared from the mining area.This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land.When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams,sediments pollute waterways.This can hurt fish and smother plant.The process in which mining companies restore land to its,The process in which mining companies restore land to its original contours and replant vegetation is called reclamation The land is changed because it is unsuitable for farming
