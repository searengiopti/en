## Drinking Water The Phosphate Risk
Phosphate impacts drinking water in many ways.First,the quantity of water is dwindling as water flows from the rivers decrease steadily.The Peace River Cumulative Impact Study suggests that phosphate mining is responsible for a significant portion of the flow reduction in some sections of the Peace River as well as reduced levels in the water table.Nitrate in Drinking WaterNatural processes can cause low levels of nitrate in drinking water—usually less than 3 mg L.The health concern is with levels of nitrate over 10 mg L.High levels of nitrate in water can be a result of runoff or leakage from fertilized soil,wastewater,landfills,animal feedlots,septic systems,or urban drainage.
