## Smithy Mills and Lathes
&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;For another $900 more than the Smithy mill,you could get a JVM 836 which will be a heck of a lot more tool than the Smithy.More capacity,much heavier and more rigid,and it will have a knee.My advice is to save your money and get the JVM 836.If JET's lathes are as good as their mills,I would say go for a JET lathe over a Smithy.Smithy lathe mill comboSmithy does sell inch rotary tables and tailstocks,but I'd bet they are for the regular mills,not the in 's at all.Another matter I notice (watching the Smithy Granite videos) is that the mill head has a square baffle around it,but still appears to be a round column mount because they show it rotated on the Z axis at left right angles.
