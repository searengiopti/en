An aggregate is considered unsound when the volume changes in aggregate induced by weather (e.g.alternate cycles of wetting and drying,or freezing and thawing),result in the deterioration of concrete.IS limit: Fine Aggregate = 10% (weight loss of five cycles with Na2SO4) Fine Aggregate = 15% (weight loss of five cycles with MgSO4)Ceramic Crushing Machine Malaysia Aggregate Crushing PlantIt has two characteristics: the upper crushing chamber has a stepped shape.The main advantage is that the increase of the volume of the crushing chamber also reduces the occlusion angle correspondingly.After you change the cavity type,the lubrication slope changes to a multistep shape.
