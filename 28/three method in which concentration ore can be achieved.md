An ore can be reduced by carbon only if its Gibbs free energy of formation falls below that of one of the carbon reduction reactions (blue lines.) Concentration of ores may be achieved by froth flotation in which an ore is contained in a froth that floats at the top of a water vat.Describe 2 methods of ore concentration and list theEnriched uranium WikipediaEnriched uranium is a type of uranium in which the percent composition of uranium 235 has been increased through the process of isotope separation Natural uranium is 99284% 238 U isotope,with 235 U only constituting about 0711% of its mass 235 U is the only nuclide existing in nature (in any appreciable amount) that is fissile with thermal neutrons.
