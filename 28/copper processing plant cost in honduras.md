## Use ore sorting equipment to concentrate ores and cut.
By using ore sorting equipment,ore concentrates can be created at very low cost in small or remote mining installations.The entire processing line can be planned in semi mobile form and consists only of crushers,screens,belts and sorting machines.This allows immense cost savings for transport,since the waste rock is disposed of on site.Copper Ore Processing MethodsThe four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining,concentrating,smelting,and refining.In a few instances,however,leaching takes the place of concentrating,smelting,and refining.At present,although considerable leaching and direct smelting ores are produced,the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.The milling of copper ores as practiced in the larger.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Everything you Need to Know
The Basics of Copper Mining and Processing.Mined from open pits,copper ore must be crushed as part of the process that occurs between extraction and production.Using today's compact mining equipment,copper ore is extracted from the mine.After the ore is crushed,it's roasted,which helps to convert sulfides to oxides.ABOUT THE OMAN MINING INDUSTRYThe company,which has copper mines at Shinas and Hatta,has also found copper deposits at Ghuzayn.National Mining,part of the MB Holding Group,is planning to do more mineral exploration in other areas for copper,gold and other minerals as well.Presently,NMC produces around 180 200 tons per day of copper concentrate at its plant.
