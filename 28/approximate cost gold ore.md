## Mineral Deposit Value How to Calculate the Potential.
As you can see in the example above,the deposit does not have to be enormous in size (only 500 meters long by 100 meters wide) to contain a valuable deposit (approximately 6 billion worth of minerals).However,in order to be as realistic as possible about this valuation,you can not assume that the complete ore body contains the same grade (i.e.2% copper and 1.5 gram per tonne gold).How Much Do Horses Cost?Anyone who owns a horse will probably tell you that the initial cost of the average riding horse is really only the tip of the iceberg.Keeping a horse is a luxury for many people.But how much does the 'average' horse cost?
