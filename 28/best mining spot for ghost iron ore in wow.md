## What should i be mining to get the most gold? reddit
Khorium is the most expensive ore but its a rare Outland spawn.Its either a toss up between Fel Iron or Ghost Iron most likely.And while Fel Iron is a higher value ore for me id still go with Ghost Iron.Outland mining is kinda a pain with the zone structure so im guessing Ghost Iron will yield a far greater ore.Leveling Mining from 1 to 700Generally every single ore spot will have 2 5 mobs nearby or on top.Keep a lookout for groups of mobs.Dwarves and Gnomes: Given the general association of Dwarves with Mining you'd think the Dwarf starting area would be the best place to start,right?
