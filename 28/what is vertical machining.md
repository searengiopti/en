## Multiaxis machining Wikipedia
Multiaxis machining is a manufacturing process that involves tools that move in 4 or more directions and are used to manufacture parts out of metal or other materials by milling away excess material,by water jet cutting or by laser cutting This type of machining was originally performed mechanically on large complex machinBroaching (metalworking) WikipediaBroaching is a machining process that uses a toothed tool,called a broach,to remove material.There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary.In linear broaching,which is the more common process,the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut.
