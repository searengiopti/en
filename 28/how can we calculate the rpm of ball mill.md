## ATTRITORS AND BALL MILLS HOW THEY WORK Robert E.…
There are quite a few types of Attritors; we can categorize them as dry grind Attritors,wet grind Attritors,regular speed Attritors,and high speed Attritors.A useful and simple equation describing the grinding momentum is M x V (mass x velocity),which enables us to see how the Attritor fits into the family of mills.For example,ball mills useBall Mill Critical SpeedA Ball Mill Critical Speed (actually ball,rod,AG or SAG) is the speed at which the centrifugal forces equal gravitational forces at the mill shell’s inside surface and no balls will fall from its position onto the shell.The imagery below helps explain what goes on inside a mill as speed varies.Use our online formula The mill speed is typically defined as the percent of the Theoretical.
