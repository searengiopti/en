## Antimony Mineral Processing Xinhai
Then after the process of gravity,there will be a process of flotation,the tailings from the preview gravity separation will be grinded,separated,stirred,and separated.And the flotation will apply the process of one roughing,three cleanings,and two scavenging.Then high grade antimony.
