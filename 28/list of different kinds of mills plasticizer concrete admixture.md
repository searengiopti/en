## Effects of Different Mineral Admixtures on the Properties.
Aug 30,2013Â Â· From Figure 6,there are several important aspects of concrete that can be identified with different mineral admixtures.First is the replacement level.The content of SF and MK is 15% maximum,whereas FA and RHA have 30% and 20% maximum replacement levels,respectively.With respect to water binder ratio,at 5% replacement level,the maximum slump is with MK concrete.Mineral And Chemical Admixtures Types Engineering IntroMineral admixtures are the fine ground solid materials I.e.Fly ash,slag and silica fume.It is added to the concrete generally in larger amount than any other type.Because mineral admixtures have an ability to enhance workability as well as finish ability of freshly laid concrete.Mineral admixtures are also utilized as a replacement of cement.
