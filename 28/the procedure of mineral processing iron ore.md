Iron ore processing by Rio Tinto in the Pilbara region of Western Australia does not involve any chemical treatment.Flowsheets for the Brockman 2 and Paraburdoo processing plants are given in Figures 8.4 and 8.5 (Kinnel,2013).The flowsheets are relatively simple.Dry processing involves up to three crushing circuits to produce lump and fines.How iron is made material,manufacture,making,history.Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes.The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 92 94% iron and 3 5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.Pig iron has only limited uses,and most of this iron goes on to a steel mill where it is converted into.
