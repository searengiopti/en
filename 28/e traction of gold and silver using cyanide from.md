## How Is Gold Extracted From Gold Ore? Sciencing
Gold is usually found alone or alloyed with mercury or silver,but can also be found in ores such as calaverite,sylvanite,nagyagite,petzite and krennerite.Most gold ore now comes from either open pit or underground mines.The ores sometimes contain as little as 5 100 of an ounce of gold.Use of ferricyanide for gold and silver cyanidationgold silver ore samples (A,B and C from Barrick Gold Co.) were also used to examine the effect of ferricyanide on gold silver extraction.The grades of gold and silver in the three samples are shown in Table 1.X ray fluorescence(XRF) analysis indicated the gangue in the samples mainly occurring as quartz and the possible

## Dissolve Gold and Silver with Cyanide
The addition of gold or silver to an alkaline sodium cyanide solution will cause the gold and silver to react with the cyanide and dissolve into the solution in a process called cyanidation.This process is more frequently referred to as leaching.As well as reacting with the precious metals,the cyanide will react with iron,copper or zinc that may be in the ore.In order to leach the.A review of gold extraction using non cyanide …In this paper,we summarized the research progress and facing challenges in gold extraction using these non cyanide reagents.After a brief introduction to the preparation method,the transformation process of various sulfur containing species in alkaline solutions was discussed.Thereafter,some insights into the mechanism of gold leaching in.
