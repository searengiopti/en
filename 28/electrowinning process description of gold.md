This signifies that,during the electrowinning process,the potential for gold reduction will also shift to more negative potentials as the gold is removed from the solution.This may result in a change in the rate limiting step of the electro chemical reaction from diffusion control to chemical control when a constant potential is applied.Electrowinning 101: What is electrowinning?Electrowinning is a widely used technology in modern metal recovery,mining,refining and waste water treatment applications.Electrowinning is one of the oldest electrolytic processes known and was first introduced in 1807 by English chemist Humphry Davy.After 66 long years the first commercial refinery Balbach and Sons Refining and Smelting Company adopted the electrowinning technology and.
