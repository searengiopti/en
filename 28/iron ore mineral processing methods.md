## Iron Ore Statistics and Information USGS
Iron ore is a mineral substance which,when heated in the presence of a reductant,will yield metallic iron (Fe).It almost always consists of iron oxides,the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3).Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.Mining McLanahanGenerally in minerals processing,minerals are recovered from their ores using several operations,including comminution,sizing,concentration and dewatering.The term "minerals processing" can be applied to a wide array of industries,such as gold,coal,nickel,aluminum,oil sands,phosphate,potash,copper,iron ore and many more.
