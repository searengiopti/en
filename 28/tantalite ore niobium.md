## Coltan [Columbite Tantalites] Ore
Coltan (short for columbite tantalites and known industrially as tantalite) is a dull black metallic ore from which the elements niobium and tantalumare are extracted.The niobium dominant mineral in coltan is columbite (after niobium's original American name,columbium),and the tantalum dominant mineral is tantalite.Columbite has the.Tantalum VS Niobium Magic Metal TantalumTantalum niobium ore is the main ore of tantalum and niobium,and a small amount of tantalum and niobium exist in tungsten and some rare earth ores.Properties.Tantalum and niobium are both high melting metals with melting points of 2996℃ and 2468℃ respectively.

## Economic Geology of Niobium and Tantalum
Tantalum ore has characteristically grades of about 0.03% Ta 2 O 5,generally as a co product of cassiterite and other minerals.Note that because of facile overgrinding,metallurgical recovery of columbite by crushing and milling hard rock ore is often as low as 50%.Tantalum is silvery grey,heavy and very hard but malleable and ductile.Extract Tantalum & Niobium from PegmatitesTantalite Upgrading and Recovery.Development of a beneficiation process for tantalum and niobium recovery was initiated on Sample A.Although the mica and Ta2O5 content of the sample was higher than the pegmatite average,sample A offered a good initial evaluation of process requirements.

By 1865,scientists discovered that columbium and niobium were one and the same,as well as distinct from tantalum.For the next century,columbium and niobium were interchangeably used.But to avoid confusion,niobium became its official name in 1949 although columbium is still in use today in the United States,mainly in metallurgy.Tantalum Tungsten HRMR Korea SiO2 BaSO4HRMR is a global supplier of Conflict Free Certified Tantalum products,Tungsten,WO3 & various chemical products including SiO2 and BaSO4.Click for prices and inquiries.
