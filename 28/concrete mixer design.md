Design and Calculation of a Concrete Mixer (100 kg) Min Min Shwe Sin.Abstract In this paper describe the design and calculation of concrete mixer for weight 350 kg approximately.A concrete mixer machine is a device that homogeneously combines cement,aggregate such as sand or gravel,and water to form concrete.What is meant by ratio in mixture of 1:2:4 in concrete.May 31,2018 · The mix 1:2:4 represents the M15 grade of concrete,which means the concrete formed with this ratio has compressive strength of 15 kN m^2.1:2:4 represents the amount of cement,fine aggregate (sand) and coarse aggregate to be added during batchin.
