## Anatomy,Head and Neck,Mastication Muscles StatPearls.
The primary muscles of mastication (chewing food) are the temporalis,medial pterygoid,lateral pterygoid,and masseter muscles.The four main muscles of mastication attach to the rami of the mandible and function to move the jaw (mandible).The cardinal mandibular movements of mastication are elevation,depression,protrusion,retraction,and side to side movement.Teeth names: Diagram,types,and functionsTeeth are made up of different layers — enamel,dentin,pulp,and cementum.Enamel,which is the hardest substance in the body,is on the outside of the tooth.

## Mastication (Chewing): Definition & Muscles Biology.
Mastication Definition.Mastication is the mechanical grinding of food into smaller pieces by teeth; it is essentially a technical word for "chewing".Mastication breaks down food so that it can go through the esophagus to the stomach.Breaking down food into smaller pieces also increases its surface area so that digestive enzymes can continue to break it down more efficiently.Jaw anatomy BritannicaJaw,either of a pair of bones that form the framework of the mouth of vertebrate animals,usually containing teeth and including a movable lower jaw (mandible) and fixed upper jaw (maxilla).Jaws function by moving in opposition to each other and are used for biting,chewing,and the handling of

## Structure and Function of the Cervical Spine Physiopedia
The cervical spine (neck) starts at the base of skull and extends down to the thoracic spine.The neck joins head with trunk and limbs and it works as a major conduit for structures between them.Flexibility of neck movement allows and maximise necessary positions for head functions and its sensory organs.There are many important structures in the neck area such as nerves,muscles,arteries.Macroevolution,function,and modularity of the …Feeding is a primary function of the vertebrate head,and the morphology of the jaw reflects the varied approaches to accomplishing this task that have evolved over hundreds of millions of years.From highly complex structures with many bones,as in most fishes,to the single dentary bone of mammals,vertebrate jaws are subjected to diverse selection pressures from different diets,and they.
