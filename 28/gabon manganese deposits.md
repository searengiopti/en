## Evolution of Lateritic Manganese Deposits SpringerLink
Abstract.Manganese is a transition element placed just before Fe in the periodic table.It is,after Fe,the second most abundant heavy metal in the lithosphere,at about 0.1%,which is about 50 times less but 12 to 15 times more than Ni and Cu.Giyani Metals Corp. Emerging High Grade Manganese.Manganese ore mined from 1957 to 1967 at Kgwakgwe Hill consisted almost entirely of such high grade manganese oxide nodules grading 40 50% total manganese (Source: Botswana Notes and Records,Vol.30,p.147 156).The deposit lies within the Kanye Basin,which is underlain by rocks of the Transvaal Supergroup ("Transvaal").
