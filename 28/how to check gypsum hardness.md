## LESSON 4: HOW CAN WE TELL THE HARDNESS OF ROCKS?
The hardness of various rocks and minerals can be used as an another method of identification.In the 19th.century,a German mineralogist Friedrich Mohs,devised a scale of hardness for minerals.Moh's Hardness.Hardness of gypsum&quot;Mohs&quot; hardness is the resistance to scratching and is a relative measure e.g.Diamond will scratch Quartz and Quartz will scratch Gypsum etc.Another measure of hardness is the Brinell hardness.

2020 3 3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Calcite would scratch the gold,but gypsum would not because gypsum is a 2 and calcite is a 3.That would mean gold is between the hardness of gypsum and calcite,or 2.5 on the scale.A hardness of 2.5 means that gold is a relatively soft mineral.It is only about as hard as your fingernail.Read about Mineral hardness.MOHS' SCALE OF HARDNESSOne of the most striking examples of this is kyanite,which has a hardness of 5.5 parallel to the 1 direction ( c axis),while it has a hardness of 7.0 parallel to the 100 direction ( a axis).Talc (1),the softest mineral on the Mohs scale has a hardness greater than gypsum (2) …

## Mohs Scale of Mineral Hardness
Mohs Scale of Mineral Hardness.In 1812 the Mohs scale of mineral hardness was devised by the German mineralogist Frederich Mohs (1773 1839),who selected the ten minerals because they were common or readily available.The scale is not a linear scale,but somewhat arbitrary.Ultracal® 30 Gypsum Cement USGUltracal® 30 Gypsum Cementis a traditional tooling gypsum cement,specially formulated for close tolerance tooling.Low absorption Ultracal® 30 Gypsum Cement: Is recommended where extreme accuracy and surface hardness are required (i.e.duplicator molds) Provides the lowest expansion of any rapid setting gypsum cement
