## Geological Society Making sense of sedimentary rocks
The huge variety of sedimentary rocks is due to the many ways that sediment can be derived,and the wide range of environments in which it may be deposited.Features common to most sedimentary rocks are their occurrence in layers (beds or strata),and the occasional occurrence within them of fossils.Sedimentary rocksEffects of grain size on the reactivity of limestone temper in aThe present study investigated the mineralogical and microstructural changes that occur in a kaolinitic clay tempered with different contents of limestone sand with two skewed grain size distributions,after firing.The firing temperatures were set at 500,750 and 1000 °C.The mineralogy of the fired bodies was analyzed by

Particle size,also called grain size,means the diameter of individual grains of sediment,or the lithified particles in clastic rocks.The term may also be used for other granular materials.(approx.inches).What is the texture of limestone?

Some of the oolites may be of algal origin.When the grains formed by the process are more than two millimeters in diameter (about the size of the head of a pin),they are called pisolites.Many limestones in Kansas (particularly of Pennsylvanian age) contain oolites.Most outcrops of oolitic limestone are found in the easternDolomite: A sedimentary rock known as dolostone or.What is Dolomite? Dolomite,also known as "dolostone" and "dolomite rock," is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of the mineral dolomite,CaMg(CO 3) 2.Dolomite is found in sedimentary basins worldwide.It is thought to form by the postdepositional alteration of lime mud and limestone by magnesium rich groundwater.Dolomite and limestone are very similar rocks.
