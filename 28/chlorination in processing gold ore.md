## The recovery of gold from refractory ores by the use of.
Abstract.Recently,the U.S.Bureau of Mines examined the recovery of gold by chlorination of refractory carbonaceous and sulfidic ores,comparing various treatment methods in which a ground ore pulp is contacted with chlorine gas and activated carbon is added to the pulp for a carbon in chlorine.Roasting (metallurgy) WikipediaRoasting is a process of heating of sulphide ore to a high temperature in presence of air.It is a step of the processing of certain ores.More specifically,roasting is a metallurgical process involving gas solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s).Often before roasting,the ore has already been partially purified,e.g.by froth flotation.
