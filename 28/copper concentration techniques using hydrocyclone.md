## CN103157558A Beneficiation method of recovering sulfur.
The invention belongs to the field of mineral processing,relates to a beneficiation method,and particularly relates to a method of sorting copper sulfide ore flotation tailings.The method comprises the following steps: A,the tailings with copper and sulfur separated are dewatered through a thickener,wherein the content of the sulfur in the tailings is more than 20%,and the concentration.Determining the Amount of Copper(II) Ions in a Solution.When dissolving copper in nitric acid,copper(II) ions produce a blue colored solution.It is possible to determine the concentration of copper(II) ions,focusing on the hue of the color,using a smartphone camera.A free app can be used to measure the hue of the solution,and with the help of standard copper(II) solutions,one can graph a calibration curve to determine the concentration of.
