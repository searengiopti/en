Cone crushers were originally designed and developed by Symons around 1920 and therefore are often described as Symons cone crushers As the mechanisms of crushing in these crushers are similar to gyratory crushers their designs are similar,but in this case the spindle is supported at the bottom of the gyrating cone instead of being suspended as in larger gyratory crushersCone CrusherThe secondary crushers are designated as Standard cone crushers having stepped liners and tertiary Short Head cone crushers,which have smoother crushing faces and steeper cone angles of the breaking head.The approximate distance of the annular space at the discharge end designates the size of the cone crushers.
