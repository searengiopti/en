Chromite,tantalite,heavy minerals,ferrous and non ferrous ores and PGM bearing ores are typically characterised on shaking tables.Mineral Density Separator The MDS is a laboratory scale unit that utilises both differences in particle density and to a lesser extent size to fractionate coarser ores.Heavy Liquid Testing ProcedureThe general procedure is as follows.The sample is placed in the liquid of lowest specific gravity and is split into two fractions.The float fraction is set aside to be weighed and assayed.The sinks fraction is washed in a suitable solvent,dried and placed in the liquid of a higher specific gravity.This process is continued in steps of suitable S.G.differences until a small final sinks.

Shawn Pure gold is not magnetic.That is,it doesn't form a magnet on its own.If you put it in a magnetic field it will magnetize a tiny bit,but only so long as it's in the field.and the direction of the magnetizaqtion makes it weakly repel the magnet.There are alloys of gold,for example gold with more than about 20% of the atoms replaced by iron,which do magnetize on their own,at.Effectiveness of Gravity Separation Methods for the2017331&ensp&#0183&enspmineral [6].The results of a gravity separation of Itakpe (Nigeria) iron ore by jigging indied that the iron recovery increased with decrease in particle size [8].This present study investigated the response of Baban Tsauni (Nigeria) leadgold ore to jigging separation,multigravity and shaking table separation.
