## Calcium Aluminate an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Calcium aluminate cement (CAC) was first developed in France in 1914 as an alternative construction material to Portland cement for use where acidic groundwaters,especially those containing sulphate ions,might lead to durability problems.Because this cement has a higher alumina content than that of Portland cement,it is often called high.DENKA CSA SHRINKAGE COMPENSATING CEMENT INTRODUCTION Raw materials used in the manufacture of Denka CSA (Calcium Sulpho Aluminate) include quick lime,gypsum,bauxite.
