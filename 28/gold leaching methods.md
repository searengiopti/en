## US7682420B2 Method for leaching gold Google Patents
In a method for leaching gold from copper sulfides,the sulfide ores are first subjected to leaching of copper,thereby producing a leaching residue having 7.9% or less of the copper content.This leaching residue is mixed with a leach liquor,which contains the chloride ion and ferric ion and has 1.9 or less of pH.Gold and copper can be effectively leached from the copper sulfide ores.Gold leaching by organic base polythionates: new non toxic.Gold leaching is the key stage in process of gold mining.There are a few well reputed leaching methods using a variety of different reagents.Nowadays the most popular industrial processes include cyanide,thiourea,and thiosulfate leaching methods.
