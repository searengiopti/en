## Processes for Beneficiation of Iron Ores IspatGuru
Mar 28,2015 · Processes for Beneficiation of Iron Ores Iron is an abundant element in the earth's crust averaging from 2 % to 3 % in sedimentary rocks to 8.5 % in basalt and gabbro.Because iron is present in many areas,it is of relatively low value and thus a deposit must have a high percentage of metal to be considered ore grade.Iron Production Ohio History CentralIron production during the early nineteenth century usually occurred on "plantations." These were relatively isolated communities established on land owned by an iron company.Usually,all of the items necessary to produce iron,limestone,timber,coal,and iron ore,were readily available.
