## SART Mining SGS
The SART process has been used successfully at several full scale mining operations and more plants currently under construction.SGS is a leader in the SART process.We provide flowsheet development,testing,pilot plant development and ongoing support at full sized operations using SART and other cyanide recovery processes.Artisanal and Small Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury.This process is mostly used in large scale mining operations but has been increasingly adopted in small scale mining because of its high gold recovery rate and low cost.The best practices for chemical leaching are a combination of pre concentration and mill leaching,as they lead to the least amount of waste,a short processing time for miners.
