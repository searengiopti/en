A slurry of ground ore,water and a weak cyanide solution is fed into large steel leach tanks where the gold and silver are dissolved.Following this leaching process the slurry passes through six adsorption tanks containing carbon granules which adsorb the gold and silver.This process removes 93% of the gold and 70% of the silver.Copper,Explained Global X ETFs20 02 2018&#0183;&#32;Open pit mining,which accounts for approximately 90% of copper production,extracts ores near the earth’s surface via graduated steps that lead into the earth’s crust 1,2 When ore is too deep to mine via open pit operations,underground mining may be utilized,which involves digging shafts into the earth’s surface to allow machines or explosives to,

## The mining process
Copper concentrate is fed into the ISASMELT furnace,where it is heated to 1185 degrees Celsius.This process melts the concentrate into liquid,drawing out impurities and releasing sulfur dioxide gas,which is captured and piped to the Incitec Pivot Acid Plant adjacent to our smelter stack for conversion into sulphuric acid,used in crop fertilisers.Copper Production: How Is Copper Made?&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The refining techniques employed by copper producers depend on the ore type,as well as other economic and environmental factors.Currently,about 80 percent of global copper production is extracted from sulfide sources.
