## Chapter 6.1 Arsenic World Health Organization
20131010&ensp&#0183&enspArsenic appears in nature primarily in the form of sulfides in association with the sulfides of ores of silver,lead,copper,nickel,antimony,cobalt and iron.Trace amounts of arsenic are found in soils and other environmental media.Arsenic is mainly transported in the environment by water.In oxygenated water,arsenic usuallyArsenic trioxide WikipediaArsenic trioxide,sold under the brand name Trisenox among others,is an inorganic compound and medication.As an industrial chemical major uses include in the manufacture of wood preservatives,pesticides,and glass.As a medication it is used to treat a type of cancer known as acute promyelocytic leukemia.For this use it is given by injection into a vein.
