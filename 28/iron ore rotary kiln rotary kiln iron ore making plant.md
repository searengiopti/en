## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes.
It is an agglomerating process of converting iron ore fines into 'uniformed sized iron ore pellets' which can be charged directly into a blast furnace (BF) or into a vertical furnace or rotary kiln normally used for the production of direct reduced iron (DRI).The iron ore pellets are shown in Fig 1.Modelling and optimization of a rotary kiln direct.The kiln model applied in this work was developed by Hatch over a number of years and has been used for several rotary kiln projects.It has its roots in a FORTRAN program that was developed by Venkateswaran (1978) to study the reduction of iron ore.The original software was used to model the operation of a 35 m pilot kiln at the Stellco company
