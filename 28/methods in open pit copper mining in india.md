## New approach for selection of waste dump sites in open pit
2018119&ensp&#0183&enspThis paper presents an approach to waste dump site selection in open pit mines using the integration of multiattribute decision making (MADM) methods.Different MADM methods often produce different outcomes.To make the best decision for dump site selection,the results of subjective and objective MADM methods are considered for a final decision.What are the main methods of mining? American.There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.
