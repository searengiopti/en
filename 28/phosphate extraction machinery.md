## Study on removal of Fe3+ from sodium dihydrogen phosphate.
Several methods based on solvent extraction,,are used to remove cationic (Fe 3+,Al 3+,Mg 2+) in phosphate industry,however conventional solvent extractions require high phase volume ratio of solvent water.Thus,the emulsification extraction is introduced to extract Fe 3+ from the NaH 2 PO 4 solution in this paper.Extraction kinetics of ruthenium in the mixture of tri n.The extraction kinetics of ruthenium in the mixture of tri n butyl phosphate and n dodecane has been investigated experimentally,using a constant interfacial area stirred cell.Effect of stirring speed,temperature,specific interfacial area and concentrations of reactant and nitric acid on the extraction rate of ruthenium were studied to identify the reaction location,extraction reaction.

## Phosphate Mining and the Paradox of Abundance Edge Effects
 · But that didn’t spell the end of phosphate; in the mid 19th century the British began mining phosphate rock,and in the following decades it took over as the primary source to produce fertilizer.Today,phosphate is the key ingredient in modern agriculture.Indeed,it could be argued that phosphates make modern plantation systems possible.Froth flotation WikipediaFroth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing,paper recycling and waste water treatment industries.Historically this was first used in the mining industry,where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.
