Unlike calcite,gypsum does not react with dilute acid to form bubbles,although if the gypsum is crushed into a powder it may simply dissolve.Quartz: Quartz crystals and masses may have the same luster as calcite,but quartz does not exhibit cleavage and will not react with dilute acid.Quartz is also much harder than calcite.What happens when acid reacts with limestone? …2 天前&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3).This is not very soluble,so rocks don't dissolve very quickly.But if you add an acid,you add hydrogen ions (H+),which will react with the carbonate to form hydrogen carbonate HCO3 ions,which are very soluble in water,and the limestone will dissolve.Or,if there is more acid,two hydrogen ions will

## Does Elemental Sulfur Lower Soil pH? Agvise Laboratories
Once all calcium carbonate in the soil has been neutralized by sulfuric acid,only then can the soil pH be lowered permanently.It is important to note that sulfate sources,such as gypsum (CaSO 4 ),do not create sulfuric acid when they react with soil,so they cannot neutralize the calcium carbonate.Production of Gypsum Products from Waste Battery Acid2012 10 13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;sulphuric acid (H 2SO 4) from the batteries is neutralised with the aid of either calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) or calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) will produce gypsum (CaSO 4.2H 2O),a valuable product in plasterboard and cement production.The suitability of the gypsum produced depends greatly on the purity,crystal shape,crystal size and moisture.
