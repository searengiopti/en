## Application Risks and Benefits of Using Aluminium in.
The study shows that the level of risk associated with the use of aluminium alloys in underground coal mines in the United States of America is extremely low (high uncontrolled use no ignitions).It is proposed that where similar equipment and conditions exist in underground coal mines in Australia,the level of risk is comparable.Reducing injury risks associated with underground coal.The final outcome of the project is a "Handbook for the Control of Injury Risks Associated with Underground Coal Mining Equipment" which documents the injury risks,controls,and outstanding issues.The handbook (Appendix A) also incorporates a generic equipment in jury risk assessment tool,and a training DVD.

## Mining health and safety: 7 common risks to protect.
 · The mining industry has a reputation for being a risky business,with health risks that are varied and often quite serious,and it is important for miners to protect themselves accordingly.Nevertheless,mining doesn’t have to be unsafe.With the introduction of strict safety legislation and protocol,as well as advances in safety equipment,the industry has seen its fatality rate drop over.The Most Common Accidents in the Mining Industry · The yearly average in coal mining decreased to 30 fatalities from 2001 2005,though 60 to 70 miners still die each year in the U.S.coal and non coal mining industry.The most common accidents occurring in the mining industry are the result of poisonous or explosive gases or mishaps relating to the use of explosives for blasting operations.
