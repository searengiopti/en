## Separating Iron and gold from rock.by Elsa Huber on Prezi
There are many ways to extract iron ore from rock.Iron is magnetic so you could use a method that involves magnets,and it is also heavier than a lot of substances,so you could use a shaker and see which pieces weigh more.However,the way that we thought to separate iron.What is Magnetism in the separation of mixtures?Separation Methods: Magnetism Magnetism is ideal for separating mixtures of two solids,with one part having magnetic properti Some metals like iron,nickel,and cobalt have magnetic properties whiles gold,silver and aluminum do not Magnetic elements are attracted to a magnet It works like this: Let us take a mixture of sand and iron.
