Today,the most commonly used types of jaw crusher are the single toggle and the double toggle designs.The original double toggle jaw crusher was designed by Eli Whitney Blake in the USA in 1857.The motion of the swing jaw in a double toggle crusher is such that it applies an almost purely compressive force upon the material being crushed.OLESI Orbital Crusher mysiteThe OLESI line of crushers incorporates the wear components into the body of the machine to form the structure.All components are bolt on and nearly weld free.This means every time you order a new set of liners,your machine is returned to factory specification.
