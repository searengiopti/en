## Physico Mechanical Characterizations of Sand Concrete.
The use of the sand concrete makes it possible to carry out a concrete having.of fillers of sand which is a co product (waste) of massive rock crushing.a small percentage of fillers,is efficient in the manufacture of prestressed beams.concrete What water:cement:sand ratio gives the.A ratio by weight of 0.5 water,1 cement,3 sand,and 3 gravel should make a fine concrete,although a little less water (0.4 by weight) would make stronger concrete.The same by volume ( ie.buckets) is a good ratio as well,1 2 to 1 to 3 to 3 (or a little less water too much water weakens the concrete,and there will always be some water.
