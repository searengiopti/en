## Explaining Motor Failure Electrical Construction.
Explaining Motor Failure The squirrel cage induction motor's versatility and ruggedness continue to make it the workhorse of the industry,but that doesn't mean it's invincible.Pushing it too hard for too long can cause the stator,rotor,bearings,and shaft to fail.Numerous industry surveys document which parts fail and how,but very little.LEESON® Motor Temperature Reference LEESON® ElectricThe chief enemy of an electric motor&#39;s insulation system is heat.It&#39;s crucial the motor stays within limits for long life.This is measurable at the surface.
