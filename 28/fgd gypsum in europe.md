## Marketing of Byproduct Gypsum From Flue Gas Desulfurization
MARKETING OF BYPRODUCT GYPSUM FROM FLUE GAS DESULFURIZATION EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION This study involved investigating the marketing of byproduct gypsum as a more economical means of operating flue gas desulfurization (FGD) processes at utility power plants.gypsum was also being used in Europe as a soil conditioner called.Review of Global GypSupply Conference & Exhibition 2018.The industry directly employs 28,000 workers in Europe and annually trains in the region of 25,000 installers.Eurogypsum promotes 'best practice' in the European gypsum industry.Gypsum,he said,is really the 'wonder mineral:' it cannot burn,it is non toxic,it is infinitely recyclable and has a synthetic equivalent in FGD gypsum.
