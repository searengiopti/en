## Colliery: How Coal Mining Works? Science ABC
Dec 11,2018 · Surface mining and underground mining are the two major schools of coal mining.To qualify for surface mining,the coal deposits must be within 50 80 meters of the surface.The job of a miner primarily involves removing 'overburden'— rock,soil,trees etc. that mix with the coal deposits and cover them near the earth's surface.Research on the Stability Evaluation Model of …Backfill strip mining,which combines the advantages of strip mining and backfill mining,is proposed to overcome high cost and shortage of filling materials in coal mines at present.The composite support pillar (CSP) is a combined support pillar of the filling body and coal pillar for supporting the overlying strata and achieving subsidence control.The stability of CSP is the key to the.
