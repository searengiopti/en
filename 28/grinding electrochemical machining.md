## ELECTROCHEMICAL MACHINING
Electrochemical machining (ECM) is a metal removal process based on the principle of reverse electroplating.In this process,particles travel from the anodic material (workpiece) toward the cathodic material (machining tool).A current of electrolyte fluid carries away the deplated material before it has a chance to reach the machining tool.Wear of hode in abrasive electrochemical grinding ofThe measurements of diamond grinding wheels were done directly on the electrochemical grinder ESCB40 just after finishing of mechanical grinding and electrochemical (ECG).There were following machining parameter applied: U =6 V,F y =30 N,v c =20 m s,and electrolyte on the basis of NaNO 3 with additives.
