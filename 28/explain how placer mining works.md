Some gold can be found by panning in rivers; heavy gold will remain in the pan,whereas lighter rocks and minerals float out.This small scale form of gold mining has little effect on the body of water,but the large scale practice of mining gold from ore can have tremendous negative effects on water quality.Cradle mining tool BritannicaIn placer mining.pan was the rocker,or cradle,named for its resemblance to a child's cradle.As it was rocked,it sifted large quantities of ore.Gravel was shoveled onto a perforated iron plate,and water was poured over it,causing finer material to drop through the perforations and onto an apron.
