## Tunnelling methods BBT SE
In tunnel construction,we differentiate between two excavation methods: blasting and mechanised tunnelling using tunnel boring machines (TBMs).The choice of excavation method depends on various factors e.g.route length,nature of the rock mass,economic framework conditions and planned construction period.TUNNELS,SHAFT AND DEVELOPMENT HEADINGS BLAST.blasting productivity.Drilling in the crumbly clinker zones was extremely difficult.Holes were drilled relatively fast but cleaning them and keeping them open was hard to do.Drilling in the clinker areas was similar to drilling into a loosely cemented gravel pile.As soon as the drill steel was removed,rock chunks would fall in,block the.
