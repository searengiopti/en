## Rod mills,how they function
2012 11 26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Rod mills are very similar to ball mills,except they use long rods for grinding media.The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill,similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill.To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling,the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6.Ball Mills vs Rod MillsWhen the mill is rotated without feed or with very fine feed,the rods are in parallel alignment and in contact with one another for their full length.New feed entering at one end of the mill causes the rod charge to spread at that end.This produces a series of wedge shaped slots tapering toward the discharge end.The tumbling and rolling rods expend most of their crushing force on the.
