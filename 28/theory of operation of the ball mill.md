## Ball mill
The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials,and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement,silicates,refractory material,fertilizer,glass ceramics,etc.as well as for ore dressing of both ferrous and non ferrous metals.The ball mill can grind various ores and other materBall Mill Operation Grinding Circuit Startup &amp; Shutdown.Ball Mill and Grinding Circuit Preparation for Start UP The following items must be checked before the equipment in the Grinding Circuit is started.Check the ore slot feeder for obstruction or hang—ups.Check the ball mill belt feeder for undue buildup of material.Check oil level in ball mill lu
