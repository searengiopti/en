Mineral processing,art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock,or gangue.It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.The primary operations are comminution and concentration,but there are other important operations.Ground Rules template2it necessary to remove the impurities from the copper using this process (i.e.why is 98 99% copper purity insufficient)? What are the waste products produced at each step in copper ore processing? The by product of extraction is tailings.The by products of smelting are sulfur dioxide gas and slag.
