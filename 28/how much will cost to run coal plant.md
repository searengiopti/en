## The True Cost of Coal Power Skeptical Science
A major problem with coal is that its full costs are not reflected in its market price,and thus while we may seemingly purchase and burn coal cheaply,in reality we are paying a much higher cost in the long run,if we look at the big picture.Economists refer to the impacts on human and environmental health which are not reflected in the price.Existing U.S.Coal Plants SourceWatchAs of July,2008,the average cost of coal supplied to existing coal plants in the United States was $2.09 per million BTU.At 34.3% efficiency for a typical coal plant,that translates to 2.08 cents per kilowatt hour for coal.
