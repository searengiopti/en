## Crushing Plant Design and Layout Considerations
Crushing Plant Design and Layout Considerations Ken Boyd,Manager,Material Handling,AMEC Mining & Metals,Vancouver,BC ABSTRACT In mining operations,the layout of crushing plants and ancillary equipment and structures is a crucial factor in meeting production requirements while keeping capital and operational costs to a minimum.COPPER Copper productionCopper production.About 80 % of primary copper production comes from low grade or poor sulfide ores.After enrichment steps,the copper concentrates are usually treated by pyrometallurgical methods.Generally,copper extraction follows the sequence (see Figure below):.1.Beneficiation by froth flotation of ore to give&nbsp;.
