## The Average Percolation Rate for Various Soil Types Hunker
Percolation is the movement of water through soil,and the percolation rate is the speed at which that movement occurs.Percolation tests,or perc tests,measure percolation rates.Soil laboratory professionals usually measure percolation rates in terms of minutes per inch,typically in the context of septic tank testing.Kansas Bentonite: Its Properties and UtilizationFor the percolation method of bleaching,the fuller's earth type of clay is used.It requires no activation,can be used again after burning,and is less expensive than activated bentonite.These advantages,however,are apparently more than balanced by the greater efficiency of activated bentonite.
