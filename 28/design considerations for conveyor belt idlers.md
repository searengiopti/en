## Conveyor transfer point design considerations
“Problems such as improper belt support,badly sealed chutes,damaged idlers and uneven cargo distribution can all result in spillage and belt mistracking.” In a properly engineered transfer point,each component from the chute design to the cradles and dust seals is employed to maximize its specific function and contain dust and fines,while at the same time offering workers easy.design an idler for a conveyor belt systemDesign and Analysis of Belt Conveyor Roller Shaft Harshavardhan A.Kadam1,Nilesh S.Hyalij2 are the other key factors of belt conveyor design.Most of the researchers focused on design modifiion to reduce the pulley (drum) and belt failures,maintenance cost,breakdowns,energy consumption and overall cost of the system for continuous transportation of material.

## Conveyor Rollers and Idlers All State Conveyors.
Conveyor rollers either sit in the bed of an idler frame to support the belt and product or are individually attached under the conveyor to support the belt return.Return Rollers are often specified as flat steel or fitted with Rubber Disc rings under the conveyor on the return section to support the return side of the conveyor belt from.Idlers SAIMHWhere return idler sets comprise two rolls,a support frame is required which supports the idler pair and attaches the idlers to the conveyor frame.This 2 roll design forms the return belt into a 'v' trough and these return idler sets are referred to a 'V' return idlers.

The conveyor idler roller is an important part of any conveyor system because they are used to effectively support the conveyor belt and bulk materials.Conveyor idlers rollers consist of housing,shaft,bearing,housing,seals and snaps.6 key considerations for conveyor selection Processing …While these are indeed critical considerations when selecting a conveyor for a material handling application,they should not be the primary or the only evaluation metrics used.The most effective way to evaluate all of the best options for batch or continuous processing is to consider each material movement requirement from a blank starting point.
