## What happens when acid reacts with limestone? Questions,
Jun 15,2008&#0183;&#32;Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3) This is not very soluble,so rocks don't dissolve very quickly But if you add an acid,you add hydrogen ions (H+),which will react with the carbonate to form hydrogen carbonate HCO3 ions,which are very soluble in water,and the limestone will dissolve Or,if there is more acid,two hydrogen ions willwhat is limestone IRVING MATERIALS INCLimestone is a sedimentary rock,which means it was formed from small particles of rock or stone that have been compacted by pressure.Sedimentary rock is important because it often contains fossils and gives clues about what type of rock was on the Earth long ago.Just like a tree's rings tell a lot about its environment,layers found in.

## Uses of Limestone
Limestone rock is a sedimentary rock which forms in the process of sedimentation at the bottom of lakes and oceans,or in caves.It is mainly composed of mineral calcite and aragonite,both of which are crystal forms of calcium carbonate.A limestone with 95 percent or more of calcium carbonate by weight is known as a high calcium limestone.Configuration and Process Flow of Limestone Milling Plant.Limestone grinding mill is another key equipment for further processing the limestone.The limestone grinding mill belongs to the vertical grinding mill with small footprint.Limestone mill can form the independent grinding production system,thus it can efficiently and safely do the lime production process.
